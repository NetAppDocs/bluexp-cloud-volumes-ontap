You can remove a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment to move it to another system or to troubleshoot discovery issues.

.About this task

Removing a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment removes it from BlueXP. It does not delete the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. You can later rediscover the working environment--for example, if you had problems during the initial discovery.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click on the working environment you want to remove. 

. On the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the ellipses icon, and select *Remove from workspace*.

. In the Review from Workspace window, click *Remove*.

.Result

BlueXP removes the working environment. Users can rediscover this working environment from the Canvas page at any time.
