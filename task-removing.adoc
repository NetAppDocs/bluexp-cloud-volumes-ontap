The Account Admin can remove a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment to move it to another system or to troubleshoot discovery issues.

.About this task

Removing a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment removes it from BlueXP. It does not delete the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. You can later rediscover the working environment.

Removing a working environment from BlueXP enables you to do the following:

* Rediscover it in another workspace
* Rediscover it from another BlueXP system
* Rediscover it if you had problems during the initial discovery

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Settings icon, and select *Tools*.

. Select the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment that you want to remove.

. On the Review and Approve page, click *Go*.

.Result

BlueXP removes the working environment. Users can rediscover this working environment from the Canvas page at any time.
