[.lead]
The maximum number of Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems is limited to 20 per NetApp account, regardless of the licensing model in use.

A _system_ is either an HA pair or a single node system. For example, if you have two Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs and two single node systems, you'd have a total of 4 systems, with room for 16 additional systems in your account.

If you have questions, reach out to your account rep or sales team.
