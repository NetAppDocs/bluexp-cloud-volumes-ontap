If you need to perform advanced management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager or the command line interface.

== Connecting to System Manager

You might need to perform some Cloud Volumes ONTAP tasks from System Manager, which is a browser-based management tool that runs on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. For example, you need to use System Manager if you want to create LUNs.

.Before you begin

The computer from which you are accessing Cloud Manager must have a network connection to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. For example, you might need to log in to Cloud Manager from a jump host that's in your cloud provider network.

ifdef::aws[]
NOTE: When deployed in multiple AWS Availability Zones, Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configurations use a floating IP address for the cluster management interface, which means external routing is not available. You must connect from a host that is part of the same routing domain.
endif::aws[]

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

. On the right pane, click the information icon and copy the cluster management IP.

. Open a web browser on the machine that has a network connection to Cloud Volumes ONTAP and enter the IP address.

. At the login screen, enter *admin* in the User Name field, enter the password that you specified when you created the working environment, and then click *Sign In*.

.Result

The System Manager console loads. You can now use it to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Connecting to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI

The Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI enables you to run all administrative commands and is a good choice for advanced tasks or if you are more comfortable using the CLI. You can connect to the CLI using Secure Shell (SSH).

.Before you begin

The host from which you use SSH to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP must have a network connection to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. For example, you might need to SSH from a jump host that's in your cloud provider network.

ifdef::aws[]
NOTE: When deployed in multiple AZs, Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configurations use a floating IP address for the cluster management interface, which means external routing is not available. You must connect from a host that is part of the same routing domain.
endif::aws[]

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, identify the IP address of the cluster management interface:

.. On the Canvas page, select the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.. Copy the cluster management IP address that appears in the right pane.

. Use SSH to connect to the cluster management interface IP address using the admin account.
