The Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI enables you to run all administrative commands and is a good choice for advanced tasks or if you are more comfortable using the CLI. You can connect to the CLI using Secure Shell (SSH).

.Before you begin

The host from which you use SSH to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP must have a network connection to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. For example, you might need to SSH from a jump host that's in your cloud provider network.

ifdef::aws[]
NOTE: When deployed in multiple AZs, Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configurations use a floating IP address for the cluster management interface, which means external routing is not available. You must connect from a host that is part of the same routing domain.
endif::aws[]

.Steps

. In BlueXP, identify the IP address of the cluster management interface:

.. From the left navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

.. On the Canvas page, select the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.. Copy the cluster management IP address that appears in the right pane.

. Use SSH to connect to the cluster management interface IP address using the admin account.
