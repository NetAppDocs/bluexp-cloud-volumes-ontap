Azure image verification complies with enhanced NetApp security requirements. While verifying an image file is a straightforward process, Azure image signature verification does require special handlings to the well-known Azure VHD image file due to an alternation made by the Azure marketplace.

NOTE: Azure image verification is supported on Cloud Volumes ONTAP software version 9.13.0 or greater. 

== Azure's alteration of published VHD files
The leading 1MB(1048576 Bytes) of VHD file is modified by Azure. NetApp image signing skips the leading 1MB and ending 512 Bytes and signs the remaining VHD image portion. 

The leading 1MB and ending 512B of VHD file is non-executable, i.e. only metadata. No alternation to the VHD file will be made other than the leading 1MB and ending 512B now and in future

As an example, the above diagram shows a VHD file sized 10GB. But the NetApp signed portion is marked in green with size of 10GB - 1MB.
