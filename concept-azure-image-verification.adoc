Azure image verification complies with enhanced NetApp security requirements. While verifying an image file is a straightforward process, Azure image signature verification does require special handlings to the well-known Azure VHD image file due to an alternation made by the Azure marketplace.

NOTE: Azure image verification is supported on Cloud Volumes ONTAP software version 9.13.0 or greater. 

== Azure's alteration of published VHD files
The leading 1MB(1048576 Bytes) of VHD file is modified by Azure marketplace. As a result, NetApp skips the leading 1MB and signs the VHD image portion beyond the leading 1MB.

As an example, the above diagram shows a VHD file sized 10GB. But the NetApp signed portion is marked in green with size of 10GB - 1MB.
