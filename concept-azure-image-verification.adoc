Azure image verification complies with enhanced NetApp security requirements. Verifying an image file is a straightforward process.  However, the Azure image signature verification requires specific considerations for the Azure VHD image file because it is altered in the Azure marketplace.

NOTE: Azure image verification is supported on Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.15.0 and later. 

== Azure's alteration of published VHD files
The 1 MB (1048576 bytes) at the beginning and 512 bytes at the end of the VHD file is modified by Azure. NetApp signs the remaining VHD file.

In the example, the VHD file is of 10GB. The portion that NetApp signed is marked in green (10 GB - 1 MB - 512 bytes).
