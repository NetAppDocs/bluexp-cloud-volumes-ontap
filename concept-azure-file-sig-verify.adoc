The Azure image verification process generates a digest file from the VHD file by stripping 1 MB at the beginning and 512 bytes at the end, then applying a hash function. To match the signing procedure, _SHA256_ is used for hashing. You must remove the leading 1 MB and final 512 bytes from the VHD file and then verify the remaining portion.

== File signature verification workflow summary
The following is an overview of the file signature verification workflow process.

* Download the Azure image from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp Support Site^] and extract the digest (.sig) file, public key certificate (.pem) file, and chain certificate (.pem) file.

Refer to link:task-azure-download-digest-file.html[Download the Azure image digest file] for more information.

* Verify the chain of trust.

* Extract the public key (.pub) from the public key certificate (.pem).

* Use the extracted public key to decrypt the digest file. Then, compare the result against a newly generated digest of a temporary file created from the image file, with the leading 1 MB and trailing 512 bytes removed.

You can perform this step by using the following OpenSSL command:

[source,cli]
----
openssl dgst -verify <public_key> -keyform <form> <hash_function> 
-signature <digest_file> -binary <temporary_file>
----

** The OpenSSL CLI tool displays appropriate messaging for its success or failure in matching the files.
