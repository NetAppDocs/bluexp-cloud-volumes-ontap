Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports Azure resource groups moves but the workflow happens in the Azure console only. 

You can move a Working Environment from one resource group to a different resource group in Azure within the same Azure subscription. Moving resource groups between different Azure subscriptions is not supported. 

NOTE: Only Working Environments in Cloud Volumes ONTAP that were created with the configuration `create-private-link-for-storage-account` set to `false` will be available to move. 

.Steps
. Remove the Working Environment from *Canvas*. 
. Open the Azure console. 
. Execute the resource group move in the Azure console.
+
To complete the move, refer to link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription[Move resources to a new resource group or subscription in Microsoft Azureâ€™s documentation^].
. In *Canvas*, discover the Working Environment. 
. Look for the new resource group in the information for the Working Environment. 

.Result

The Working Environment and its resources (VMs, disks, storage accounts, network interfaces, snapshots) are in the new resource group.
