=== Elastic Volumes enhancement

Cloud Manager now supports the Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature when creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment from the user interface. The Elastic Volumes feature is enabled by default when using gp3 or io1 disks. You can choose the initial capacity based on your storage needs and revise it after Cloud Volumes ONTAP is deployed.
