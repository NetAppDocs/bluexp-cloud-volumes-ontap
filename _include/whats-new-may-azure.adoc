=== Annual contract in Azure

The Essentials and Professional packages are now available in Azure through an annual contract. You can contact your NetApp sales representative to purchase an annual contract. The contract is available as a private offer in the Azure Marketplace.

After NetApp shares the private offer with you, you can select the annual plan when you subscribe from the Azure Marketplace during working environment creation.
