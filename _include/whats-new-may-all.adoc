=== Enhancement to mediator upgrades

When Cloud Manager upgrades the mediator for an HA pair, it now validates that a new mediator image is available before it deletes the boot disk. This change ensures that the mediator can continue to operate successfully if the upgrade process is unsuccessful.

=== K8s tab has been removed

The K8s tab was deprecated in a previous and has now been removed. If you want to use Kubernetes with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can add managed-Kubernetes clusters to the Canvas as a working environment for advanced data management.
