=== Limited network access when using service endpoints

If you disable an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and storage accounts, Cloud Manager now limits network access when using a VNet service endpoint for the connection. Network access is limited to the VNet where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is deployed and the VNet where the Connector is deployed.
