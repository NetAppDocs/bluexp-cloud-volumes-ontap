=== Support for creating storage VMs in Google Cloud

Multiple storage VMs are now supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud, starting with the 9.11.1 release. Starting with this release of the Connector, Cloud Manager enables you to create storage VMs on Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in Google Cloud by using the API.

Support for creating storage VMs requires new Google Cloud permissions for the Connector:

[source,yaml]
- compute.instanceGroups.get
- compute.addresses.get

Note that you must use the ONTAP CLI or System Manager to create a storage VM on a single node system.
