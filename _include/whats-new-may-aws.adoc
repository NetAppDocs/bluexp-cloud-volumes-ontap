=== New AWS permissions required for the Connector

The following permissions are now required to create an AWS spread placement group when deploying an HA pair in a single Availability Zone (AZ):

[source,json]
"ec2:DescribePlacementGroups",
"iam:GetRolePolicy",

These permissions are now required to optimize how Cloud Manager creates the placement group.

Be sure to provide these permissions to each set of AWS credentials that you've added to Cloud Manager. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[View the latest Connector policy for AWS^].
