=== WORM and data tiering

When you create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 system or later, you can now enable both data tiering and WORM storage together. Enabling data tiering with WORM storage allows you to tier the data to an object store in the cloud.

Note that any data tiered to object storage doesn't include the ONTAP WORM functionality. To ensure end-to-end WORM capability, you'll need to set up the bucket permissions accordingly.
