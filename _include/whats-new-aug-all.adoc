=== MTEKM license

The Multi-tenant Encryption Key Management (MTEKM) license is now included with new and existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems running version 9.11.1 or later.

Multi-tenant external key management enables individual storage VMs (SVMs) to maintain their own keys through a KMIP server when using NetApp Volume Encryption.

=== Proxy server

Cloud Manager now automatically configures your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to use the Connector as a proxy server, if an outbound internet connection isn't available to send AutoSupport messages.

AutoSupport proactively monitors the health of your system and sends messages to NetApp technical support.

The only requirement is to ensure that the Connector's security group allows _inbound_ connections over port 3128. You'll need to open this port after you deploy the Connector.

=== Change charging method

You can now change the charging method for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that uses capacity-based licensing. For example, if you deployed a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with the Essentials package, you can change it to the Professional package if your business needs changed. This feature is available from the Digital Wallet.

=== Security group enhancement

When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, the user interface now enables you to choose whether you want the predefined security group to allow traffic within the selected network only (recommended) or all networks.
