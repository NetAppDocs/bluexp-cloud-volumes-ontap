=== MTEKM license

The Multi-tenant Encryption Key Management (MTEKM) license is now included on new and existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems running version 9.11.1 or later.

Multi-tenant external key management enables individual storage VMs (SVMs) to maintain their own keys through a KMIP for NetApp Volume Encryption.
