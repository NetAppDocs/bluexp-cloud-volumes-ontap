=== Enhancements to Google Cloud firewall policies

* When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Google Cloud, Cloud Manager will now display all existing firewall policies in a VPC.
+
Previously, Cloud Manager wouldn't display any policies in VPC-1, VPC-2, or VPC-3 that didn't have a target tag.

* When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP single node system in Google Cloud, you can now choose whether you want the predefined firewall policy to allow traffic within the selected VPC only (recommended) or all VPCs.

=== Enhancement to Google Cloud service accounts

When you select the Google Cloud service account to use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Cloud Manager now displays the email address that's associated with each service account. Viewing the email address can make it easier to distinguish between service accounts that share the same name.
