NetApp provides two options for deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP on Azure. Cloud Volumes ONTAP traditionally relies on BlueXP for deployment and orchestration. Beginning with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.16.1, you can take advantage of Azure marketplace direct deployment, a streamlined process that provides access to a limited, but still powerful set of Cloud Volumes ONTAP features and options. 

When you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP directly from the Azure marketplace, you're not required to set up the BlueXP Connector or meet other security and onboarding criteria required for deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP through BlueXP. From the Azure marketplace, you can quickly deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a few clicks and explore its core features and capabilities in your environment.

Here is the feature comparison between the two options:

[cols=3*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|  | Azure marketplace | BlueXP
| *Onboarding* | Shorter and easier, minimal preparation required for direct deployment | Longer onboarding process, including the installation of the BlueXP Connector
| *Supported virtual machine (VM) types* a| Eds_v5 and Ls_v3 instance types
[NOTE]
L8s_v3 instance type is supported in the Azure marketplace for HA configurations, but not in BlueXP. BlueXP won't be able to detect it correctly during discovery.
| Full range of VM types.
