You can create aggregates yourself or let Cloud Manager do it for you when it creates volumes. The benefit of creating aggregates yourself is that you can choose the underlying disk size, which enables you to size your aggregate for the capacity or the performance that you need.

CAUTION: All disks and aggregates must be created and deleted directly from Cloud Manager. You should not perform these actions from another management tool. Doing so can impact system stability, hamper the ability to add disks in the future, and potentially generate redundant cloud provider fees.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance on which you want to manage aggregates.

. Click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

. Click *Add Aggregate* and then specify details for the aggregate.

* If you're prompted to choose a disk type and disk size, refer to link:task-planning-your-config.html[Plan your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration in AWS].

* If you're prompted to enter the aggregate's capacity size, then you're creating an aggregate on a configuration that supports the Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature. This feature is automatically enabled on new aggregates that use gp3 or io1 disks, as long as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system was created from version 9.11.0 or later.

The following screenshot shows an example of a new aggregate comprised of gp3 disks.
