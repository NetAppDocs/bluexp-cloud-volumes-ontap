If you have an unassigned node-based license for Cloud Volumes ONTAP that you haven't used, you can exchange the license by converting it to a Cloud Backup license, a Cloud Data Sense license, or a Cloud Tiering license.

Exchanging the license revokes the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license and creates a dollar-equivalent license for the service:

* Licensing for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair is converted to a 51 TiB data service license
* Licensing for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP single node is converted to a 32 TiB data service license

The converted license has the same expiry date as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP license.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

Cloud Manager converts the unassigned license to the service that you selected. You can view the new license in the *Data Services Licenses* tab.

=== Obtain a system license file

In most cases, Cloud Manager can automatically obtain your license file using your NetApp Support Site account. But if it can't, then you'll need to manually upload the license file. If you don't have the license file, you can obtain it from netapp.com.

.Steps

. Go to the https://register.netapp.com/register/getlicensefile[NetApp License File Generator^] and log in using your NetApp Support Site credentials.

=== Update a system license

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. Select *Node Based Licenses* from the drop-down.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click *Update License*.

.Result

Cloud Manager updates the license on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You can purchase extra capacity licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than the 368 TiB of capacity that's provided with a BYOL system license. For example, you might purchase one extra license capacity to allocate up to 736 TiB of capacity to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Or you could purchase three extra capacity licenses to get up to 1.4 PiB.

The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited.

=== Convert an Eval license to a BYOL

An evaluation license is good for 30 days. You can apply a new BYOL license on top of the evaluation license for an in-place upgrade.

When you convert an Eval license to a BYOL, Cloud Manager restarts the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

* For a single-node system, the restart results in I/O interruption during the reboot process.
* For an HA pair, the restart initiates takeover and giveback to continue serving I/O to clients.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select *Node Based Licenses* from the drop-down.

. Click *Eval*.

. In the table, click *Convert to BYOL License* for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Enter the serial number or upload the license file.

. Click *Convert License*.

.Result

Cloud Manager starts the conversion process. Cloud Volumes ONTAP automatically restarts as part of this process. When it's back up, the licensing information will reflect the new license.
