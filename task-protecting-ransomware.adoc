Ransomware attacks can cost a business time, resources, and reputation. BlueXP enables you to implement two NetApp solutions for ransomware: Protection from common ransomware file extensions and Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP). These solutions provide effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation.

== Protection from common ransomware file extensions 

Available through BlueXP, the Ransomware Protection setting allows you to utilize the ONTAP FPolicy functionality to guard against common ransomware file extension types.  

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the system you configure to ransomware protection.

. On the Overview tab, click the Features panel and then click the pencil icon next to *Ransomware Protection*.

. Implement the NetApp solution for ransomware:

.. Click *Activate Snapshot Policy*, if you have volumes that do not have a Snapshot policy enabled.
+
NetApp Snapshot technology provides the industry’s best solution for ransomware remediation. The key to a successful recovery is restoring from uninfected backups. Snapshot copies are read-only, which prevents ransomware corruption. They can also provide the granularity to create images of a single file copy or a complete disaster recovery solution.

.. Click *Activate FPolicy* to enable ONTAP's FPolicy solution, which can block file operations based on a file's extension.
+
This preventative solution improves protection from ransomware attacks by blocking common ransomware file types.
+
The default FPolicy scope blocks files that have the following extensions:
+
micro, encrypted, locked, crypto, crypt, crinf, r5a, XRNT, XTBL, R16M01D05, pzdc, good, LOL!, OMG!, RDM, RRK, encryptedRS, crjoker, EnCiPhErEd, LeChiffre
+
TIP: BlueXP creates this scope when you activate FPolicy on Cloud Volumes ONTAP. The list is based on common ransomware file types. You can customize the blocked file extensions by using the _vserver fpolicy policy scope_ commands from the Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI.

== Autonomous Ransomware Protection 

Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports the Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) feature, which performs analyses on workloads to proactively detect and warn about abnormal activity that might indicate a ransomware attack.

Separate from the file extension protections provided through the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-protecting-ransomware.html#protection-from-common-ransomware-file-extensions[ransomware protection setting], the ARP feature uses workload analysis to alert the user on potential attacks based on detected “abnormal activity”. Both the ransomware protection setting and the ARP feature can be used in conjunction for comprehensive ransomware protection.    

The ARP feature is available for use with BYOL licenses only (one, two, and three year terms) on both node-based and capacity-based licensing models. You must contact your NetApp sales representative to purchase a new, separate, add-on license for use with the ARP feature in Cloud Volumes ONTAP.  

Upon purchase of an add-on license and adding it to the Digital Wallet, you can enable ARP on a per volume basis with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Configuration of ARP for volumes is performed through ONTAP System Manager and ONTAP CLI. 

For more information on how to enable ARP with ONTAP System Manager and CLI, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/enable-task.html[Enable Autonomous Ransomware Protection^]. 

NOTE: Support is not available for the use of licensed features without a license.
