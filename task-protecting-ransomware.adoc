Ransomware attacks can cost a business time, resources, and reputation. Cloud Manager enables you to implement the NetApp solution for ransomware, which provides effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation.

Using this feature to improve protection against ransomware addresses a separate use case from https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[the ONTAP anti-ransomware feature^] that you can enable through System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the *Ransomware* icon.

. Implement the NetApp solution for ransomware:

.. Click *Activate Snapshot Policy*, if you have volumes that do not have a Snapshot policy enabled.
+
NetApp Snapshot technology provides the industryâ€™s best solution for ransomware remediation. The key to a successful recovery is restoring from uninfected backups. Snapshot copies are read-only, which prevents ransomware corruption. They can also provide the granularity to create images of a single file copy or a complete disaster recovery solution.

.. Click *Activate FPolicy* to enable ONTAP's FPolicy solution, which can block file operations based on a file's extension.
+
This preventative solution improves protection from ransomware attacks by blocking common ransomware file types.
+
The default FPolicy scope blocks files that have the following extensions:
+
micro, encrypted, locked, crypto, crypt, crinf, r5a, XRNT, XTBL, R16M01D05, pzdc, good, LOL!, OMG!, RDM, RRK, encryptedRS, crjoker, EnCiPhErEd, LeChiffre
+
TIP: Cloud Manager creates this scope when you activate FPolicy on Cloud Volumes ONTAP. The list is based on common ransomware file types. You can customize the blocked file extensions by using the _vserver fpolicy policy scope_ commands from the Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI.
