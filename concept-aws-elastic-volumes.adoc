Support for the Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP aggregate provides better performance and additional capacity, while enabling Cloud Manager to automatically increase the underlying disk capacity as needed.

== Benefits

* Dynamic disk growth
+
Cloud Manager can dynamically increase the size of disks while Cloud Volumes ONTAP is running and while disks are still attached.

* Higher performance
+
Aggregates that are enabled with Elastic Volumes can have up to 8 disks, which provides more throughput. In addition, the disks are equally utilized across a RAID group, which provides consistent performance.

* Larger aggregates
+
Each aggregate can have up to 8 disks (this is more than the 6 disk limit for aggregates that aren't enabled with the Elastic Volumes feature). Support for 8 disks provides a maximum aggregate capacity of 128 TiB.
+
NOTE: Total system capacity limits remain the same.

== Supported configurations

The Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature is supported with specific Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions and specific EBS disk types.

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP version

The Elastic Volumes feature is supported with _new_ Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems deployed with version 9.11.0 and later. The feature is _not_ supported with existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that were deployed prior to 9.11.0.

=== EBS disk types

The Elastic Volumes feature is automatically enabled at the aggregate level when using General Purpose SSDs (gp3) or Provisioned IOPS SSDs (io1). Aggregates that use any other disk type are not supported.

== Required AWS permissions

The Connector requires the following permissions to enable and manage the Elastic Volumes feature on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP aggregate:

* ec2:DescribeVolumesModifications
* ec2:ModifyVolume

== How Cloud Volumes ONTAP works with Elastic Volumes

An aggregate that has the Elastic Volumes feature enabled has 1 to 2 RAID groups. Each RAID group has 4 identical disks that have the same capacity. Here's an example of a 10 TiB aggregate that has 4 disks with 2.5 TiB each:

image:diagram-aws-elastic-volumes-one-raid-group.png[]

When the aggregate is created, it starts with 1 RAID group. If additional capacity is needed, Cloud Manager grows the aggregate by increasing the capacity of all disks in the RAID group by the same amount. The capacity increases by whichever number is lower: either 10% of the aggregate's size or 256 GiB.

For example, if you have a 1 TiB aggregate, each disk is 250 GiB. 10% of the aggregate's capacity is 100 GiB. That's lower than 256 GiB, so the size of the aggregate is increased by 100 GiB (or 25 GiB for each disk).

Cloud Manager increases the size of the disks while the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is running and while the disks are still attached. The change is non-disruptive.

If an aggregate reaches 64 TiB (or 16 TiB on each disk), Cloud Manager creates a second RAID group for additional capacity. This second RAID group works just like the first one: it has 4 disks that have the exact same capacity and it can grow up to 64 TiB. That means an aggregate can have a maximum capacity of 128 TiB.

=== How Cloud Manager chooses an aggregate for new volumes

If you create a volume that uses gp3 or io1 disks, Cloud Manager creates the volume on an aggregate as follows:

* If there are no existing aggregates that support Elastic Volumes, Cloud Manager creates the aggregate and then creates the volume on that new aggregate.
+
The size of the aggregate is based on the requested volume size plus an additional 10% capacity.

* If there is an existing aggregate that supports Elastic Volumes, Cloud Manager creates the volume on that aggregate.

* If there are multiple aggregates that support Elastic Volumes, Cloud Manager creates the volume on the aggregate that requires the least amount of resources.

== Limitations

* Increasing the size of an aggregate can take up to 8 hours. During that time, Cloud Manager can't request any additional capacity for that aggregate.

* Creating a new system with Elastic Volumes enabled on the initial aggregate is supported with the API only at this time. It's not supported with the Cloud Manager user interface.
+
All other actions (such as creating a new aggregate) are supported from the user interface.

== How to work with Elastic Volumes in Cloud Manager

* Create a new system with Elastic Volumes enabled on the initial aggregate

This action is only supported with the API at this time. It's not supported from the user interface.

* Create a new volume on an aggregate with Elastic Volumes enabled
+
If you create a volume that uses gp3 or io1 disks, Cloud Manager automatically creates the volume on an aggregate with Elastic Volumes enabled.

* Create a new aggregate with Elastic Volumes enabled
+
Elastic Volumes is automatically enabled on new aggregates that use gp3 or io1 disks, as long as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system was created from version 9.11.0 or later.

* Add capacity to an aggregate
+
While Cloud Manager automatically grows aggregates as needed, you can manually increase the capacity yourself.

* Replicate data to an aggregate with Elastic Volumes enabled
+
When you choose the destination disk type for data replication, Elastic Volumes will be enabled when you choose a gp3 or io1 disk.
