Upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP from Cloud Manager to gain access to the latest new features and enhancements. You should prepare Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems before you upgrade the software.

== Upgrade overview

You should be aware of the following before you start the Cloud Volumes ONTAP upgrade process.

=== Upgrade from Cloud Manager only

Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from Cloud Manager. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

=== How to upgrade

Cloud Manager provides two ways to upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* By following upgrade notifications that appear in the working environment
* By placing the upgrade image at an HTTPS location and then providing Cloud Manager with the URL

=== Supported upgrade paths

The version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP that you can upgrade to depends on the version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP that you're currently running.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Current version
| Versions that you can directly upgrade to

| 9.10.0 | 9.10.1

.2+| 9.9.1
| 9.10.1
| 9.10.0

| 9.9.0
| 9.9.1

| 9.8	| 9.9.0

| 9.7 |	9.8

| 9.6	|	9.7

| 9.5	|	9.6

| 9.4 |	9.5

| 9.3	|	9.4

|===

Note the following:

* The supported upgrade paths for Cloud Volumes ONTAP are different than they are for an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

* If you upgrade by following the upgrade notifications that appear in a working environment, Cloud Manager will prompt you to upgrade to a release that follows these supported upgrade paths.

* If you upgrade by placing an upgrade image at an HTTPS location, be sure to follow these supported upgrade paths.

* In some cases, you might need to upgrade a few times to reach your target release.
+
For example, if you're running version 9.8 and you want to upgrade to 9.10.0, you first need to upgrade to version 9.9.0, then to 9.9.1, and finally to 9.10.0.

=== Reverting or downgrading

Reverting or downgrading Cloud Volumes ONTAP to a previous release is not supported.

=== Support registration

Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be registered with NetApp support in order to upgrade the software using any of the methods described on this page. This applies to both PAYGO and BYOL. You'll need to link:task-registering.html[manually register PAYGO systems], while BYOL systems are registered by default.

TIP: A system that isn't registered for support will still receive the software update notifications that appear in Cloud Manager when a new version is available. But you will need to register the system before you can upgrade the software.

=== Upgrades of the HA mediator

For HA systems in AWS or Google Cloud, Cloud Manager also updates the mediator instance as needed during the Cloud Volumes ONTAP upgrade process.

== Prepare to upgrade

Before performing an upgrade, you must verify that your systems are ready and make any required configuration changes.

* <<Plan for downtime>>
* <<Verify that automatic giveback is still enabled>>
* <<Suspend SnapMirror transfers>>
* <<Verify that aggregates are online>>

=== Plan for downtime

When you upgrade a single-node system, the upgrade process takes the system offline for up to 25 minutes, during which I/O is interrupted.

Upgrading an HA pair is nondisruptive and I/O is uninterrupted. During this nondisruptive upgrade process, each node is upgraded in tandem to continue serving I/O to clients.

=== Verify that automatic giveback is still enabled

Automatic giveback must be enabled on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair (this is the default setting). If it isn't, then the operation will fail.

=== Suspend SnapMirror transfers

If a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system has active SnapMirror relationships, it is best to suspend transfers before you update the Cloud Volumes ONTAP software. Suspending the transfers prevents SnapMirror failures. You must suspend the transfers from the destination system.

NOTE: Even though Cloud Backup uses an implementation of SnapMirror to create backup files (called SnapMirror Cloud), backups do not need to be suspended when a system is upgraded.

.About this task

These steps describe how to use System Manager for version 9.3 and later.

.Steps

. link:task-connecting-to-otc.html[Log in to System Manager] from the destination system.

. Click *Protection > Relationships*.

. Select the relationship and click *Operations > Quiesce*.

=== Verify that aggregates are online

Aggregates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be online before you update the software. Aggregates should be online in most configurations, but if they are not, then you should bring them online.

.About this task

These steps describe how to use System Manager for version 9.3 and later.

.Steps

. In the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

. Select an aggregate, click *Info*, and then verify that the state is online.

.. Click *Storage > Aggregates & Disks > Aggregates*.

.. Select the aggregate, and then click *More Actions > Status > Online*.

== Upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager notifies you when a new version is available for upgrade. You can start the upgrade process from this notification. For details, see <<Upgrade from Cloud Manager notifications>>.

Another way to perform software upgrades by using an image on an external URL. This option is helpful if Cloud Manager can't access the S3 bucket to upgrade the software or if you were provided with a patch. For details, see <<Upgrade by using an HTTP or FTP server>>.

=== Upgrade from Cloud Manager notifications

Cloud Manager displays a notification in Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments when a new version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available:

image:screenshot_cot_upgrade.gif[Screen shot: Shows the New version available notification which displays in the Canvas page after you select a working environment.]

You can start the upgrade process from this notification, which automates the process by obtaining the software image from an S3 bucket, installing the image, and then restarting the system.

.Before you begin

Cloud Manager operations such as volume or aggregate creation must not be in progress on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. Click *Canvas*.

. Select a working environment.
+
A notification appears in the right pane if a new version is available:
+
image:screenshot_cot_upgrade.gif[Screen shot: Shows the New version available notification which displays in the Canvas page after you select a working environment.]

. If a new version is available, click *Upgrade*.

. In the Release Information page, click the link to read the Release Notes for the specified version, and then select the *I have read...* check box.

. In the End User License Agreement (EULA) page, read the EULA, and then select *I read and approve the EULA*.

. In the Review and Approve page, read the important notes, select *I understand...*, and then click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Manager starts the software upgrade. You can perform actions on the working environment once the software update is complete.

.After you finish

If you suspended SnapMirror transfers, use System Manager to resume the transfers.

=== Upgrade from an image available at a URL

You can place the Cloud Volumes ONTAP software image on the Connector or on an HTTP server and then initiate the software upgrade from Cloud Manager. You might use this option if Cloud Manager can't access the S3 bucket to upgrade the software.

.Before you begin

Cloud Manager operations such as volume or aggregate creation must not be in progress on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. Optional: Set up an HTTP server that can host the Cloud Volumes ONTAP software image.
+
If you have a VPN connection to the virtual network, you can place the Cloud Volumes ONTAP software image on an HTTP server in your own network. Otherwise, you must place the file on an HTTP server in the cloud.

. If you use your own security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, ensure that the outbound rules allow HTTP connections so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can access the software image.
+
NOTE: The predefined Cloud Volumes ONTAP security group allows outbound HTTP connections by default.

. Obtain the software image from https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/cloud_ontap.html[the NetApp Support Site^].

. Copy the software image to a directory on the Connector or on an HTTP server from which the file will be served.
+
For example, you can copy the software image to the following path on the Connector:
+
`/opt/application/netapp/cloudmanager/docker_occm/data/ontap/images/`

. From the working environment in Cloud Manager, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Update Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. On the update software page, enter the URL, and then click *Change Image*.
+
If you copied the software image to the Connector in the path shown above, you would enter the following URL:
+
\http://<Connector-private-IP-address>/ontap/images/<image-file-name>

. Click *Proceed* to confirm.

.Result

Cloud Manager starts the software update. You can perform actions on the working environment once the software update is complete.

.After you finish

If you suspended SnapMirror transfers, use System Manager to resume the transfers.

== Fix download failures when using a Google Cloud NAT gateway

The Connector automatically downloads software updates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. The download can fail if your configuration uses a Google Cloud NAT gateway. You can correct this issue by limiting the number of parts that the software image is divided into. This step must be completed by using the Cloud Manager API.

.Step

.	Submit a PUT request to /occm/config with the following JSON as body:

[source.json]
{
  "maxDownloadSessions": 32
}

The value for _maxDownloadSessions_ can be 1 or any integer greater than 1. If the value is 1, then the downloaded image will not be divided.

Note that 32 is an example value. The value that you should use depends on your NAT configuration and the number of sessions that you can have simultaneously.
