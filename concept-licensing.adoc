Several licensing options are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Each option enables you to choose a consumption model that meets your needs.

== Licensing overview

The following licensing options are available for new customers.

Capacity-based licensing packages::
Pay for multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in your NetApp account by provisioned capacity. Includes the ability to purchase add-on cloud data services.

Keystone Flex Subscription::
A pay-as-you-grow subscription-based service that delivers a seamless hybrid cloud experience for HA pairs.

The previous by-node licensing model remains available for existing customers who have already purchased a license or who have an active marketplace subscription.

The following sections provide more details about each of these options.

== Capacity-based licensing

Capacity-based licensing packages enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity. The license is associated with your NetApp account and enables you to charge multiple systems against the license, as long as enough capacity is available through the license.

For example, you could purchase a single 20 TiB license, deploy four Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, and then allocate a 5 TiB volume to each system, for a total of 20 TiB. The capacity is available to the volumes on each Cloud Volumes ONTAP system deployed in that account.

Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a _package_. When you deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can choose from several licensing packages based on your business needs.

=== Packages

The following capacity-based packages are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Freemium

Provides all Cloud Volumes ONTAP features free of charge from NetApp (cloud provider charges still apply).

* No license or contract is needed.
* Support from NetApp is not included.
* You're limited to 500 GiB of provisioned capacity per Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* You can use up to 10 Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems with the Freemium offering per NetApp account, in any cloud provider.
* If the provisioned capacity for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system exceeds 500 GiB, Cloud Manager converts the system to the Essentials package.
+
Any other systems that have less than 500 GiB of provisioned capacity stay on Freemium (as long as they were deployed using the Freemium offering).

==== Essentials

Pay by capacity for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a number of different configurations.

* Choose your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration:
** A single node or HA system
** File and block storage or secondary data for disaster recovery (DR)
* Add on any of NetApp's cloud data services at extra cost

==== Optimized

Pay for provisioned capacity and I/O operations separately.

*	The same capabilities as the Essentials package
*	Charging is based on two cost components: storage and usage (I/O)
*	Available only in the Azure Marketplace as a pay-as-you-go offering or as an annual contract
* Supported with selected VM types: E4s_v3, E4ds_v4, DS4_v2, DS13_v2, E8s_v3, and E8ds_v4

==== Professional

Pay by capacity for any type of Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration. Includes unlimited backups with Cloud Backup.

* Provides licensing for any Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration (single node or HA with any storage type)
* Includes volume backups using Cloud Backup (only for volumes charged against this license)
* Add on any of NetApp's cloud data services at extra cost

==== Edge Cache

Licensing for https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-edge-cache[Cloud Volumes Edge Cache^]

*	The same capabilities as the Professional package
*	One Global File Cache Edge license per 3 TiB of provisioned capacity
*	Available only in the Azure Marketplace as a pay-as-you-go offering or as an annual contract

=== Consumption models

Capacity-based licensing packages are available with the following consumption models:

* *BYOL*: A license purchased from NetApp that can be used to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in any cloud provider.
+
Note that the Optimized and Edge Cache packages are not available with BYOL.

* *PAYGO*: An hourly subscription from your cloud provider's marketplace.

* *Annual*: An annual contract from your cloud provider's marketplace.

Note the following:

* If you purchase a license from NetApp (BYOL), you also need to subscribe to the PAYGO offering from your cloud provider's marketplace.
+
Your license is always charged first, but you'll be charged from the hourly rate in the marketplace in these cases:

** If you exceed your licensed capacity
** If the term of your license expires

* If you have an annual contract from a marketplace, _all_ Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that you deploy are charged against that contract. You can't mix and match an annual marketplace contract with BYOL.

=== Pricing

For details about pricing, go to https://cloud.netapp.com/ontap-cloud[NetApp Cloud Central^].

=== Free trials

A 30-day free trial is available from the pay-as-you-go subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace. The free trial includes Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup. The trial starts when you subscribe to the offering in the marketplace.

There are no instance or capacity limitations. You can deploy as many Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems as you'd like and allocate as much capacity as needed, free of charge for 30 days. The free trial automatically converts to a paid hourly subscription after 30 days.

There are no hourly software license charges for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, but infrastructure charges from your cloud provider still apply.

TIP: You will receive a notification in Cloud Manager when the free trial starts, when there are 7 days left, and when there is 1 day remaining. For example:
image:screenshot-free-trial-notification.png[A screenshot of a notification in the Cloud Manager interface that states there is only 7 days remaining on a free trial.]

=== Supported configurations

Capacity-based licensing packages are available with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 and later.

=== Capacity limit

With this licensing model, each individual Cloud Volumes ONTAP system supports up to 2 PiB of capacity through disks and tiering to object storage.

There is no maximum capacity limitation when it comes to the license itself.

=== Notes about charging

The following details can help you understand how charging works with capacity-based licensing.

==== Minimum charge

For each package, there is a minimum 4 TiB capacity charge. Any Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance that has less than 4 TiB of capacity will be charged at a rate of 4 TiB.

==== Overages

If you exceed your BYOL capacity or if your license expires, you'll be charged for overages at the hourly rate based on your marketplace subscription.

==== Essentials package

With the Essentials package, you're billed by the deployment type (HA or single node) and the volume type (primary or secondary). For example, _Essentials HA_ has different pricing than _Essentials Secondary HA_.

If you purchased an Essentials license from NetApp (BYOL) and you exceed the licensed capacity for that deployment and volume type, the Digital Wallet charges overages against a higher priced Essentials license (if you have one). This happens because BYOL is cheaper than PAYGO. We want to ensure that you're charged at a lower price.

Here's an example. Let's say you have the following licenses for the Essentials package:

* A 500 TiB _Essentials Secondary HA_ license that has 500 TiB of committed capacity
* A 500 TiB _Essentials Single Node_ license that only has 100 TiB of committed capacity

Another 50 TiB is provisioned on an HA pair with secondary volumes. Instead of charging that 50 TiB to PAYGO, the Digital Wallet charges the 50 TiB overage against the _Essentials Single Node_ license. That license is priced higher than _Essentials Secondary HA_, but it's cheaper than the PAYGO rate.

==== Storage VMs

* There are no extra licensing costs for additional data-serving storage VMs (SVMs), but there is a 4 TiB minimum capacity charge per data-serving SVM.

* Disaster recovery SVMs are charged according to the provisioned capacity.

==== HA pairs

For HA pairs, you're only charged for the provisioned capacity on a node. You aren't charged for data that is synchronously mirrored to the partner node.

==== FlexClone and FlexCache volumes

* You won't be charged for the capacity used by FlexClone volumes.

* Source and destination FlexCache volumes are considered primary data and charged according to the provisioned space.

endif::gcp[]

== Keystone Flex Subscription

A pay-as-you-grow subscription-based service that delivers a seamless hybrid cloud experience for those preferring OpEx consumption models to upfront CapEx or leasing.

Charging is based on the size of your committed capacity for one or more Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in your Keystone Flex Subscription.

The provisioned capacity for each volume is aggregated and compared to the committed capacity on your Keystone Flex Subscription periodically, and any overages are charged as burst on your Keystone Flex Subscription.

https://www.netapp.com/services/subscriptions/keystone/flex-subscription/[Learn more about Keystone Flex Subscriptions^].

=== Supported configurations

Keystone Flex Subscriptions are supported with HA pairs. This licensing option isn't supported with single node systems at this time.

=== Capacity limit

Each individual Cloud Volumes ONTAP system supports up to 2 PiB of capacity through disks and tiering to object storage.

== Node-based licensing

Node-based licensing is the previous generation licensing model that enabled you to license Cloud Volumes ONTAP by node. This licensing model is not available for new customers and no free trials are available. By-node charging has been replaced with the by-capacity charging methods described above.

Node-based licensing is still available for existing customers:

* If you have an active license, BYOL is available for license renewals only.
* If you have an active marketplace subscription, charging is still available through that subscription.

== License conversions

Converting an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to another licensing method isn't supported. The three current licensing methods are capacity-based licensing, Keystone Flex Subscriptions, and node-based licensing. For example, you can't convert a system from node-based licensing to capacity-based licensing (and vice versa).

If you want to transition to another licensing method, you can purchase a license, deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using that license, and then replicate the data to that new system.

Note that converting a system from PAYGO by-node licensing to BYOL by-node licensing (and vice versa) isn't supported. You need to deploy a new system and then replicate data to that system. link:task-manage-node-licenses.html[Learn how to change between PAYGO and BYOL].

== Max number of systems

The maximum number of Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems is limited to 20 per NetApp account, regardless of the licensing model in use.

A _system_ is either an HA pair or a single node system. For example, if you have two Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs and two single node systems, you’d have a total of 4 systems, with room for 16 additional systems in your account.

If you have questions, reach out to your account rep or sales team.
