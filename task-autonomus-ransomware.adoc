Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports the Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) feature, which performs analyses on workloads to proactively detect and warn about abnormal activity that might indicate a ransomware attack.

== Overview   

Separate from the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-protecting-ransomware.html[ransomware protection setting^], the ARP feature uses workload analysis to alert the user on potential attacks based on what it recognizes as “abnormal activity”. Both the ransomware protection setting and the ARP feature can be used in conjunction for enhanced protection from both questionable file extensions and irregular activity.    

The ARP feature is available for use with BYOL licenses only (one, two, and three year terms) on both node-based and capacity-based licensing models. You must contact your NetApp sales representative to purchase a new, separate, add-on license for use with the ARP feature in Cloud Volumes ONTAP.  

Upon purchase of an add-on license and adding it to the Digital Wallet, you can enable ARP on a per volume basis with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Configuration of ARP for volumes is performed through ONTAP System Manager and ONTAP CLI. 

For more information on how to enable ARP with ONTAP System Manager and CLI, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/enable-task.html[Enable Autonomous Ransomware Protection^]. 

NOTE: Support is not available for the use of licensed features without a license.
