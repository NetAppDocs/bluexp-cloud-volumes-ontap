CAUTION: You should not change the password for the admin account through System Manager or the CLI. The password will not be reflected in BlueXP. As a result, BlueXP cannot monitor the instance properly.

.Steps

. On the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the ellipse icon, and select *Set password*.
