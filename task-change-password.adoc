CAUTION: You should not change the password for the admin account through System Manager or the CLI. The password will not be reflected in BlueXP. As a result, BlueXP cannot monitor the instance properly.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Set password*.

. Enter the new password twice and then click *Save*.
+
The new password must be different than one of the last six passwords that you used.
