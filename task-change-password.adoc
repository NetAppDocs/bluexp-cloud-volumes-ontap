Cloud Volumes ONTAP includes a cluster admin account. You can change the password for this account from BlueXP, if needed.

CAUTION: You should not change the password for the admin account through ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. The password will not be reflected in BlueXP. As a result, BlueXP cannot monitor the instance properly.

* It cannot contain the user name
* It must be at least eight characters long
* It must contain at least one letter and one number
* It cannot be the same as the last six passwords

.Steps
