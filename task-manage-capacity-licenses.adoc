_Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

The _BlueXP digital wallet_ enables you to manage licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP from a single location. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

== How licenses are added to the BlueXP digital wallet

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp will send you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details.

In the meantime, BlueXP automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, BlueXP automatically adds the licenses to the digital wallet.

If BlueXP can't add the license, you'll need to manually add them to the digital wallet yourself. For example, if the Connector is installed in a location that doesn't have internet access, you'll need to add the licenses yourself. <<Add purchased licenses to your account,Learn how to add purchased licenses to your account>>.

== View the consumed capacity in your account

The BlueXP digital wallet shows you the total consumed capacity in your account and the consumed capacity by licensing package. This can help you understand how you're being charged and whether you need to purchase additional capacity.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, keep *Capacity Based Licenses* selected.

. View the packages summary, which shows you consumed capacity, total precommitted capacity, and total PAYGO capacity.
+
* _Total consumed capacity_ is the total provisioned capacity of all Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in your NetApp account. The charging is based on each volume's provisioned size, regardless of local, used, stored, or effective space within the volume.
+
* _Total precommitted capacity_ is the total licensed capacity (BYOL or Marketplace Contract) that you purchased from NetApp.
+
* _Total PAYGO_ is the total provisioned capacity using cloud marketplace subscriptions. Charging via PAYGO is used only if the consumed capacity is higher than the licensed capacity or if there is no BYOL license available in the BlueXP digital wallet.
+
Here's an example of a Cloud Volumes ONTAP packages summary in BlueXP digital wallet:
+
image:screenshot_capacity-based-licenses.png[A screenshot that shows a Cloud Volumes ONTAP packages summary including total consumed capacity, total precommitted capacity (BYOL and Marketplace Contracts), and total PAYGO, or provisioned, capacity in BlueXP digital wallet.]

. Under the summary, view the consumed capacity for each of your licensing packages.
+
* _Consumed capacity_ shows you the capacity of the volumes for that package. For more details about a specific package, hover your mouse over the tooltip.
+
To better understand the capacities that display for the Essentials package, you should be familiar with how charging works. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-licensing.html#notes-about-charging[Learn about charging for the Essentials package].
+
* _Precommitted capacity_ is the licensed capacity (BYOL or Marketplace Contract) that you purchased from NetApp.
** _BYOL_ shows you the licensed capacity that you purchased from NetApp for this package type.
** _Marketplace Contracts_ shows the licensed capacity that you purchased with a marketplace contract for this package type.
+
* _PAYGO_ shows you the consumed capacity by license consumption model.
+
Here's an example for an account that has several licensing packages:

== Download usage reports

Account administrators can download four usage reports from the digital wallet in BlueXP. These usage reports provide capacity details of your subscriptions and tell you how you're being charged for the resources in your Cloud Volumes ONTAP subscriptions. The downloadable reports capture data at a point in time and can be easily shared with others.

== Add purchased licenses to your account

If you don't see your purchased licenses in the BlueXP digital wallet, you'll need to add the licenses to BlueXP so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.What you'll need

* You need to provide BlueXP the serial number of the license or the license file.

* If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, keep *Capacity Based Licenses* selected and click *Add License*.

. Enter the serial number for your capacity-based license or upload the license file.
+
If you entered a serial number, you also need to select the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

. Click *Add License*.

== Update a capacity-based license

If you purchased additional capacity or extended the term of your license, BlueXP automatically updates the license in the digital wallet. There's nothing that you need to do.

However, if you deployed BlueXP in a location that doesn't have internet access, then you'll need to manually update the license in BlueXP.

.What you'll need

The license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair).

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, click the action menu next to the license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file.

. Click *Upload License*.

== Change charging methods

You can change the charging method for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that uses capacity-based licensing. For example, if you deployed a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with the Essentials package, you can change it to the Professional package if your business needs changed.

.Limitation

Changing to or from the Edge Cache license isn't supported.
endif::azure[]

.Important note

If you have a private offer or contract from your cloud provider's marketplace, changing to a charging method that's not included in your contract will result in charging against BYOL (if you purchased a license from NetApp) or PAYGO.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, click *Change Charging Method*.
+
image:screenshot-digital-wallet-charging-method-button.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP page in the BlueXP digital wallet where the Change Charging Method button is just above the table.]

+
image:screenshot-digital-wallet-charging-method.png[A screenshot of the Change Charging Method dialog box where you choose a new charging method for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.]

You might also notice that the BlueXP digital wallet refreshes the consumed capacity for each package type to account for the change that you just made.

== Remove a capacity-based license

If a capacity-based license expired and is no longer in use, then you can remove it at any time.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, click the action menu next to the license and select *Remove License*.
