Manage your capacity-based licenses from the Digital Wallet to ensure that your NetApp account has enough capacity for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

_Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

The _Digital Wallet_ enables you to manage licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP from a single location. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

== Add purchased licenses to your account

After you purchase licenses for your NetApp account, you need to add the licenses to Cloud Manager so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.What you'll need

* You need to provide Cloud Manager the serial number of the license or the license file.

* If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to Cloud Manager^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

If you entered a serial number, you also need to select the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

. Click *Add License*.

== Update a capacity-based license

If you purchased additional capacity or extended the term of your license, Cloud Manager automatically updates the license in the Digital Wallet. There's nothing that you need to do.

However, if you deployed Cloud Manager in a location that doesn't have internet access, then you'll need to manually update the license in Cloud Manager.

.What you'll need

The license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair).

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Click the action menu next to the license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Click the action menu next to the license and select *Remove License*.

. Click *Remove* to confirm.
