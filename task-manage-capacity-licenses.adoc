Manage your capacity-based licenses from the Digital Wallet to ensure that your NetApp account has enough capacity for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

_Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

The _Digital Wallet_ enables you to manage licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP from a single location. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

== How licenses are added to the Digital Wallet

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp will send you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details.

In the meantime, Cloud Manager automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, Cloud Manager automatically adds the licenses to the Digital Wallet.

If Cloud Manager can't add the license, you'll need to manually add them to the Digital Wallet yourself. For example, if the Connector is installed in a location that doesn't have internet access, you'll need to add the licenses yourself. <<Add purchased licenses to your account,Learn how to add purchased licenses to your account>>.

. If needed, purchase additional licensed capacity and then add the license to your account.

== Add purchased licenses to your account

If you don't see your purchased licenses in the Digital Wallet, you'll need to add the licenses to Cloud Manager so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.What you'll need

* You need to provide Cloud Manager the serial number of the license or the license file.

* If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to Cloud Manager^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Digital Wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, keep *Capacity Based Licenses* selected and click *Add License*.

. Enter the serial number for your capacity-based license or upload the license file.

.What you'll need

The license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair).

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Digital Wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, click the action menu next to the license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file.

== Remove a capacity-based license

If a capacity-based license expired and is no longer in use, then you can remove it at any time.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Digital Wallet*.

. On the *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* tab, click the action menu next to the license and select *Remove License*.

. Click *Remove* to confirm.
