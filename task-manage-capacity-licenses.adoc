Manage your capacity-based licenses from the Digital Wallet to ensure that your NetApp account has enough capacity for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

_Capacity-based licenses_ enable you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity.

The _Digital Wallet_ enables you to manage licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP from a single location. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

== How licenses are added to the Digital Wallet

After you purchase a license from your NetApp sales representative, NetApp will send you an email with the serial number and additional licensing details.

In the meantime, Cloud Manager automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, Cloud Manager automatically adds the licenses to the Digital Wallet.

If Cloud Manager can't add the license, you'll need to manually add them to the Digital Wallet yourself. For example, if the Connector is installed in a location that doesn't have internet access, you'll need to add the licenses yourself. <<Add purchased licenses to your account,Learn how to add purchased licenses to your account>>.

== View the consumed capacity in your account

The Digital Wallet shows you the total consumed capacity in your account and the consumed capacity by package type. This can help you understand how you're being charged and whether you should purchase additional licenses.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. With *Capacity Based Licenses* selected, view the packages summary, which shows you consumed capacity, total licensed capacity, and total PAYGO capacity.
+
* _Total consumed capacity_ is the total provisioned capacity of all Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in your NetApp account. The charging is based on each volume's provisioned size, regardless of local, used, stored, or effective space within the volume.
+
* _Total licensed_ is the total licensed capacity (BYOL) that you purchased from NetApp.
+
* _Total PAYGO_ is the total provisioned capacity using cloud marketplace subscriptions. Charging via PAYGO is used only if the consumed capacity is higher than the licensed capacity or if there is no BYOL license available in the Digital Wallet.
+
Here's an example of an account that has 2000 TiB of consumed capacity:
+

. Under the summary, view the consumed capacity for each of your licensing packages.
+
* _Consumed capacity_ shows you the total capacity of the volumes for that package. For more details about a specific package, hover your mouse over the tooltip.
+
To better understand the capacities that display for the Essentials package, you should be familiar with how charging works. link:concept-licensing.html#notes-about-charging[Learn about charging for the Essentials package].
+
* The _BYOL_ and _PAYGO_ capacities show you the total consumed capacity by license consumption model.
+
Here's an example for an account that has several licensing packages:

== Add purchased licenses to your account

If you don't see your purchased licenses in the Digital Wallet, you'll need to add the licenses to Cloud Manager so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.What you'll need

* You need to provide Cloud Manager the serial number of the license or the license file.

* If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add your NetApp Support Site account to Cloud Manager^]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Click *Add License*.

. Enter the serial number for your capacity-based license or upload the license file.
+
If you entered a serial number, you also need to select the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

. Click *Add License*.

== Update a capacity-based license

If you purchased additional capacity or extended the term of your license, Cloud Manager automatically updates the license in the Digital Wallet. There's nothing that you need to do.

However, if you deployed Cloud Manager in a location that doesn't have internet access, then you'll need to manually update the license in Cloud Manager.

.What you'll need

The license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair).

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Click the action menu next to the license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file.

. Click *Upload License*.

== Remove a capacity-based license

If a capacity-based license expired and is no longer in use, then you can remove it at any time.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Click the action menu next to the license and select *Remove License*.

. Click *Remove* to confirm.
