[.lead]
You can launch a single node system or an HA pair in Azure by creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment in BlueXP.

.What you'll need

You need the following to create a working environment.

[[licensing]]
* A Connector that's up and running.

** You should have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[Connector that is associated with your workspace^].

** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[You should be prepared to leave the Connector running at all times^].

* An understanding of the configuration that you want to use.
+
You should have chose a configuration and obtained Azure networking information from your administrator. For details, see link:task-planning-your-config-azure.html[Planning your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration^].

* An understanding of what's required to set up licensing for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

link:task-set-up-licensing-azure.html[Learn how to set up licensing^].

.About this task

When BlueXP creates a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure, it creates several Azure objects, such as a resource group, network interfaces, and storage accounts. You can review a summary of the resources at the end of the wizard.

[WARNING]
.Potential for Data Loss
====
The best practice is to use a new, dedicated resource group for each Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

Deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP in an existing, shared resource group is not recommended due to the risk of data loss. While BlueXP can remove Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources from a shared resource group in case of deployment failure or deletion, an Azure user might accidentally delete Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources from a shared resource group.

The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Working Environment Name | BlueXP uses the working environment name to name both the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and the Azure virtual machine. It also uses the name as the prefix for the predefined security group, if you select that option.

| Resource Group Tags | Tags are metadata for your Azure resources. When you enter tags in this field, BlueXP adds them to the resource group associated with the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You can add up to four tags from the user interface when creating a working environment, and then you can add more after its created. Note that the API does not limit you to four tags when creating a working environment.

For information about tags, refer to https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-using-tags/[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Using tags to organize your Azure resources^].

| User name and password | These are the credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster administrator account. You can use these credentials to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through System Manager or its CLI. Keep the default _admin_ user name or change it to a custom user name.

| [[video]]Edit Credentials | You can choose different Azure credentials and a different Azure subscription to use with this Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. You need to associate an Azure Marketplace subscription with the selected Azure subscription in order to deploy a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-azure-accounts.html[Learn how to add credentials^].

| Description

| Resource Group

a| Create a new resource group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP or use an existing resource group. The best practice is to use a new, dedicated resource group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. While it is possible to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in an existing, shared resource group, it's not recommended due to the risk of data loss. See the warning above for more details.

TIP: If the Azure account that you're using has the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html[required permissions^], BlueXP removes Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources from a resource group, in case of deployment failure or deletion.

| Generated security group a| If you let BlueXP generate the security group for you, you need to choose how you'll allow traffic:

* If you choose *Selected VNet only*, the source for inbound traffic is the subnet range of the selected VNet and the subnet range of the VNet where the Connector resides. This is the recommended option.
* If you choose *All VNets*, the source for inbound traffic is the 0.0.0.0/0 IP range.

| Use existing | If you choose an existing security group, then it must meet Cloud Volumes ONTAP requirements. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/reference-networking-azure.html#security-group-rules[View the default security group^].

. *Subscribe from the Azure Marketplace*: Follow the steps if BlueXP could not enable programmatic deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

. *Underlying Storage Resources*: Choose settings for the initial aggregate: a disk type, a size for each disk, and whether data tiering to Blob storage should be enabled.
+
Note the following:
+
* The disk type is for the initial volume. You can choose a different disk type for subsequent volumes.
* The disk size is for all disks in the initial aggregate and for any additional aggregates that BlueXP creates when you use the simple provisioning option. You can create aggregates that use a different disk size by using the advanced allocation option.
+
For help choosing a disk type and size, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-planning-your-config-azure.html#size-your-system-in-azure[Sizing your system in Azure^].
