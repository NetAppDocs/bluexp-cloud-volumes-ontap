=== Restricted availability of BYOL licensing for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Beginning June 25, 2025, NetApp has restricted the bring your own license (BYOL) licensing model for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. BYOL licensing will be restricted for all customers. This change affects all Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployments in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The only exemptions to this restriction are the U.S. Public Sector customers and China region deployments. 

NetApp support and services will continue until your BYOL contract expires, but your expired licenses will not be renewed or extended. When your BYOL licenses expire, you must replace your BYOL licenses with cloud marketplace subscriptions. Contact your NetApp account team or customer success representatives to discuss your options for transitioning to a capacity-based licensing model. Transitioning to a capacity-based licensing model through hyperscaler marketplaces streamlines the licensing experience and delivers greater business benefits.
