=== BlueXP enables the discovery of deployments made through the Azure marketplace

BlueXP now has the capability of discovering the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems deployed through Azure marketplace direct deployment. This means that you can now add and manage these systems as working environments in BlueXP, just like any other Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

=== Ability to tier data for another Azure tenant
You can now enable tiering for a different Azure tenant in a scenario where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment is created by one tenant and the BlueXP Connector is created by another. This allows you to use the same Connector to tier data for multiple Azure tenants.
