===  WORM and ARP functionalities are no longer chargeable
The built-in data protection and security features of WORM (Write Once Read Many) and ARP (Autonomous Ransomware Protection) will be offered with Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses at no extra cost. The new pricing model applies to both new and existing BYOL and PAYGO/marketplace subscriptions of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Both capacity-based and node-based licenses will contain ARP and WORM for all configurations, including single node and high-availability (HA) pairs, at no additional cost.

The simplified pricing brings you these benefits:

* Accounts that currently include WORM and ARP will no longer incur charges for these features. Going forward, your billing will only have charges for capacity usage, as it was before this change. WORM and ARP will no longer be included in your future bills.
* If your current accounts do not include these features, you can now opt for WORM and ARP at no additional cost.
* All Cloud Volumes ONTAP offerings for any new accounts will exclude charges for WORM and ARP.
