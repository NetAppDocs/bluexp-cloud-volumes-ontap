=== Storage VM creation automated through the APIs in Google Cloud 

You can now use the BlueXP APIs to automate the storage VM creation in Google Cloud. You have been using this feature in Cloud Volumes ONTAP high-availability (HA) configurations, and now you can also use it in single node deployments. By using the BlueXP APIs, you can easily create, rename, and delete additional data-serving storage VMs in your Google Cloud environment, without the need to manually configure the required network interfaces, LIFs, and management LIFs. This automation simplifies the process of managing storage VMs and enhances the overall efficiency of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment.
