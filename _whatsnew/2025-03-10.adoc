=== Storage VM creation automated through APIs in Azure

You can now use BlueXP APIs to create, rename, and delete additional data-serving storage VMs for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure. Using the APIs automates the process of storage VM creation, including the configuration of the required network interfaces, LIFs, and a management LIF, if you need to use a storage VM for management purposes.
