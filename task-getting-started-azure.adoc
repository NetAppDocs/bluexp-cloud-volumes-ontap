Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure in a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Connector^] yet, an Account Admin needs to create one. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[Learn how to create a Connector in Azure^]

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Note that if you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a subnet where no internet access is available, then you need to manually install the Connector and access the BlueXP user interface that's running on that Connector. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Learn how to manually install the Connector in a location without internet access^]

This step isn't required if you're deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a location where no internet access is available.
