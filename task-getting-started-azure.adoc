Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure in a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Connector^] yet, an Account Admin needs to create one. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-azure.html[Learn how to create a Connector in Azure^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager prompts you to deploy a Connector if you don't have one yet.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. link:task-planning-your-config-azure.html[Learn more].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VNet and subnets will support connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VNet so the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.
+
This step is important because the Connector can't manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference-networking-azure.html[the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP].
