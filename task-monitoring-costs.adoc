Cloud Manager enables you to view the resource costs associated with running Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can also see how much money you saved by using NetApp features that can reduce storage costs.

.About this task

Cloud Manager updates the costs when you refresh the page. You should refer to AWS for final cost details.

.Step

. Verify that Cloud Manager can obtain cost information from AWS:

.. Ensure that the IAM policy that provides Cloud Manager with permissions includes the required permissions.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[View the required permissions^]

.. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html[Activate the *WorkingEnvironmentId* tag^].
+
To track your AWS costs, Cloud Manager assigns a cost allocation tag to Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances. After you create your first working environment, activate the *WorkingEnvironmentId* tag. User-defined tags don't appear on AWS billing reports until you activate them in the Billing and Cost Management console.

. On the Canvas page, select a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and then click *Cost*.
+
The Cost page displays costs for the current and previous months and shows your annual NetApp savings, if you enabled NetApp's cost-saving features on volumes.

The following image shows a sample Cost page:
