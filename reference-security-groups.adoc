BlueXP creates AWS security groups that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Volumes ONTAP needs to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

== Rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

The security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules

When you create a working environment and choose a predefined security group, you can choose to allow traffic within one of the following:

* *Selected VPC only*: the source for inbound traffic is the subnet range of the VPC for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and the subnet range of the VPC where the Connector resides. This is the recommended option.

* *All VPCs*: the source for inbound traffic is the 0.0.0.0/0 IP range.

=== Outbound rules

The predefined security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP opens all outbound traffic. If that is acceptable, follow the basic outbound rules. If you need more rigid rules, use the advanced outbound rules.

==== Basic outbound rules

The predefined security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP includes the following outbound rules.
