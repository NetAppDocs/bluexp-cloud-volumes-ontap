Cloud Manager creates AWS security groups that include the inbound and outbound rules that the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP need to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

== Rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

The security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules

The source for inbound rules in the predefined security group is 0.0.0.0/0.
