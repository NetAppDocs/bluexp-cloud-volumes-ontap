[.lead]
Set up your Azure networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly. This includes networking for the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking

The following networking requirements must be met in Azure.

=== Outbound internet access

Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.

Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:

* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup

link:task-setting-up-ontap-cloud.html[Learn how to configure AutoSupport].

=== Security groups

You don't need to create security groups because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to the security group rules listed below.

=== IP addresses

Cloud Manager allocates the following number of IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure:

* Single node: 5 IP addresses
* HA pair: 16 IP addresses

Note that Cloud Manager creates an SVM management LIF on HA pairs, but not on single node systems in Azure.

TIP: A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port. An SVM management LIF is required for management tools like SnapCenter.

=== Secure connections to Azure services

Cloud Manager sets up a VNet service endpoint and an Azure Private Link endpoint so that Cloud Volumes ONTAP can privately connect to Azure services.

==== Service endpoint

Cloud Manager enables a VNet service endpoint to create a secure connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage for data tiering. No additional service endpoints are supported from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure services.

Cloud Manager enables a VNet service endpoint for you if the Cloud Manager policy has these permissions:

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action",

These permissions are included in the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy].

For details about setting up data tiering, see link:task-tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

==== Private endpoint

By default, Cloud Manager enables an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts. A Private Link secures connections between endpoints in Azure and provides performance benefits. In most cases, there's nothing that you need to do--Cloud Manager manages the Azure Private Link for you. But if you use Azure Private DNS, then you'll need to edit a configuration file. You can also disable the Private Link connection, if desired.

link:task-enabling-private-link.html[Learn more about using an Azure Private Link with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== Connections to other ONTAP systems

To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the Azure VNet and the other networkâ€”for example, an AWS VPC or your corporate network.

For instructions, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Create a Site-to-Site connection in the Azure portal^].

== Requirements for the Connector

Set up your networking so that the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-configuring-proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server^].

=== Connections to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the VPCs and VNets in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

== Security group rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager creates Azure security groups that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Volumes ONTAP needs to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

The security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules for single node systems

The rules listed below allow traffic, unless the description notes that it blocks specific inbound traffic.
