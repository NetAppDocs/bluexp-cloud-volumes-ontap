You can choose from several instance or types when you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can change the instance type at any time if you determine that it is undersized or oversized for your needs.

.About this task

* Automatic giveback must be enabled on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair (this is the default setting). If it isn't, then the operation will fail.

* Changing the instance type can affect AWS service charges.

* The operation restarts Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
For single node systems, I/O is interrupted.
+
For HA pairs, the change is nondisruptive. HA pairs continue to serve data.
+
TIP: Cloud Manager gracefully changes one node at a time by initiating takeover and waiting for give back. NetApp's QA team tested both writing and reading files during this process and didn't see any issues on the client side. As connections changed, we did see retries on the I/O level, but the application layer overcame these short "re-wire" of NFS/CIFS connections.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the working environment.

. In the right pane, click the menu icon and select *Optimize Cost & Performance*.

TIP: This option is also available by entering the working environment, opening the action menu, and selecting *Change instance*.

. If you are using a node-based PAYGO license, you can optionally choose a different license.

. Choose an instance type, select the check box to confirm that you understand the implications of the change, and then click *OK*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP reboots with the new configuration.
