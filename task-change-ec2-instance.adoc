You can choose from several instance or types when you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can change the instance type at any time if you determine that it is undersized or oversized for your needs.

.About this task

* Automatic giveback must be enabled on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair (this is the default setting). If it isn't, then the operation will fail.
+
http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-hacg/GUID-3F50DE15-0D01-49A5-BEFD-D529713EC1FA.html[ONTAP 9 Documentation: Commands for configuring automatic giveback^]

* Changing the instance type can affect AWS service charges.

* The operation restarts Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
For single node systems, I/O is interrupted.
+
For HA pairs, the change is nondisruptive. HA pairs continue to serve data.
+
TIP: BlueXP gracefully changes one node at a time by initiating takeover and waiting for give back. NetApp's QA team tested both writing and reading files during this process and didn't see any issues on the client side. As connections changed, we did see retries on the I/O level, but the application layer overcame these short "re-wire" of NFS/CIFS connections.
