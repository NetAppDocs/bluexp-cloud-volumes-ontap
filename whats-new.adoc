=== Marketplace updates

* The Essentials package and Professional package are now available in all cloud provider marketplaces.
+
These by-capacity charging methods enable you to pay by the hour or to purchase an annual contract directly from your cloud provider. You still have the option to purchase a by-capacity license directly from NetApp.
+
If you have an existing subscription in a cloud marketplace, you're automatically subscribed to these new offerings as well. You can choose by-capacity charging when you deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.
+
If you're a new customer, BlueXP will prompt you to subscribe when you create a new working environment.

* By-node licensing from all cloud provider marketplaces is deprecated and no longer available for new subscribers. This includes annual contracts and hourly subscriptions (Explore, Standard, and Premium).
+
This charging method is still available for existing customers who have an active subscription.

When creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure, you now have the option to select an existing resource group for the VM and its associated resources.

image:screenshot_azure_resource_group.png[A screenshot of the Create Working Environment wizard where you can select an existing resource group.]

The following permissions enable BlueXP to remove Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources from a resource group, in case of deployment failure or deletion:

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/delete",

Be sure to provide these permissions to each set of Azure credentials that you've added to BlueXP. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html[View the latest Connector policy for Azure^].

=== Blob public access now disabled in Azure

As a security enhancement, BlueXP now disables *Blob public access* when creating a storage account for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Azure Private Link enhancement

By default, BlueXP now enables an Azure Private Link connection on the boot diagnostics storage account for new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

This means _all_ storage accounts for Cloud Volumes ONTAP will now use a private link.

link:task-enabling-private-link.html[Learn more about using an Azure Private Link with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== Balanced persistent disks in Google Cloud

Starting with the 9.9.1 release, Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports Balanced persistent disks (pd-balanced).

These SSDs balance performance and cost by providing lower IOPS per GiB.

=== custom-4-16384 no longer supported in Google Cloud

The custom-4-16384 machine type is no longer supported with new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

If you have an existing system running on this machine type, you can keep using it, but we recommend switching to the n2-standard-4 machine type.

== 30 May 2021

The following changes were introduced with the 3.9.7 release of the Connector.

=== New Professional Package in AWS

A new Professional Package enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup Service by using an annual contract from the AWS Marketplace. Payment is per TiB. This subscription doesn't enable you to back up on-prem data.

If you choose this payment option, you can provision up to 2 PiB per Cloud Volumes ONTAP system through EBS disks and tiering to S3 object storage (single node or HA).

Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details and go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to learn more about this licensing option.

=== Tags on EBS volumes in AWS

BlueXP now adds tags to EBS volumes when it creates a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. The tags were previously created after Cloud Volumes ONTAP was deployed.

This change can help if your organization uses service control policies (SCPs) to manage permissions.

=== Minimum cooling period for auto tiering policy

If you enabled data tiering on a volume using the _auto_ tiering policy, you can now adjust the minimum cooling period using the API.

link:task-tiering.html#changing-the-cooling-period-for-the-auto-tiering-policy[Learn how to adjust the minimum cooling period.]

=== Enhancement to custom export policies

When you create a new NFS volume, BlueXP now displays custom export policies in ascending order, making it easier for you to find the export policy that you need.

=== Deletion of old cloud snapshots

BlueXP now deletes older cloud snapshots of root and boot disks that are created when a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is deployed and every time its powered down. Only the two most recent snapshots are retained for both the root and boot volumes.

This enhancement helps reduce cloud provider costs by removing snapshots that are no longer needed.

Note that a Connector requires a new permission to delete Azure snapshots. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html[View the latest Connector policy for Azure^].

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/delete"

== 24 May 2021

link:task-getting-started-aws-c2s.html[Learn how to get started in C2S].

=== AWS encryption with customer-managed CMKs

BlueXP has always enabled you to encrypt Cloud Volumes ONTAP data using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.0, data on EBS disks and data tiered to S3 are encrypted if you select a customer-managed CMK. Previously, only EBS data would be encrypted.

Note that you'll need to provide the Cloud Volumes ONTAP IAM role with access to use the CMK.

link:task-setting-up-kms.html[Learn more about setting up the AWS KMS with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== Support for Azure DoD

You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in the Azure Department of Defense (DoD) Impact Level 6 (IL6).

=== IP address reduction in Google Cloud

We've reduced the number of IP addresses that are required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later in Google Cloud. By default, one less IP address is required (we unified the intercluster LIF with the node management LIF). You also have the option to skip the creation of the SVM management LIF when using the API, which would reduce the need for an additional IP address.

link:reference-networking-gcp.html#requirements-for-cloud-volumes-ontap[Learn more about IP address requirements in Google Cloud].

=== Shared VPC support in Google Cloud

When you deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Google Cloud, you can now choose shared VPCs for VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3. Previously, only VPC-0 could be a shared VPC. This change is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later.

link:reference-networking-gcp.html[Learn more about Google Cloud networking requirements].

== 4 Jan 2021

The following changes were introduced with the 3.9.2 release of the Connector.

=== AWS Outposts

A few months ago, we announced that Cloud Volumes ONTAP had achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts Ready designation. Today, we're pleased to announce that we've validated BlueXP and Cloud Volumes ONTAP with AWS Outposts.

If you have an AWS Outpost, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in that Outpost by selecting the Outpost VPC in the Working Environment wizard. The experience is the same as any other VPC that resides in AWS. Note that you will need to first deploy a Connector in your AWS Outpost.

There are a few limitations to point out:

* Only single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are supported at this time
* The EC2 instances that you can use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP are limited to what's available in your Outpost
* Only General Purpose SSDs (gp2) are supported at this time

=== Ultra SSD VNVRAM in supported Azure regions

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can now use an Ultra SSD as VNVRAM when you use the E32s_v3 VM type with a single node system https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[in any supported Azure region^].

VNVRAM provides better write performance.

=== Choose an Availability Zone in Azure

You can now choose the Availability Zone in which you'd like to deploy a single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you don't select an AZ, BlueXP will select one for you.

image:screenshot_azure_az.gif[A screenshot of the Availability Zone drop-down list that's available after choosing a region.]

=== Larger disks in Google Cloud

Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports 64 TB disks in GCP.

NOTE: The maximum system capacity with disks alone remains at 256 TB due to GCP limits.

=== New machine types in Google Cloud

Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports the following machine types:

* n2-standard-4 with the Explore license and with BYOL
* n2-standard-8 with the Standard license and with BYOL
* n2-standard-32 with the Premium license and with BYOL
