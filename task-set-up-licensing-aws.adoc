== Freemium

== Capacity-based license

Capacity-based licensing enables you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity. Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a _package_: the Essentials package or the Professional package.

The Essentials and Professional packages are available with the following consumption models:

* A license (BYOL) purchased from NetApp
* An hourly, pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription from the AWS Marketplace
* An annual contract from the AWS Marketplace

link:concept-licensing.html[Learn more about capacity-based licensing].

The following sections describe how to get started with each of these consumption models.

=== BYOL

Pay upfront by purchasing a license (BYOL) from NetApp to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in any cloud provider.

.Steps

. https://cloud.netapp.com/contact-cds[Contact NetApp Sales to obtain a license^]

. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html#add-an-nss-account[Add your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP^]
+
BlueXP automatically queries NetApp's licensing service to obtain details about the licenses associated with your NetApp Support Site account. If there are no errors, BlueXP automatically adds the licenses to the digital wallet.
+
Your license must be available from the BlueXP digital wallet before you can use it with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. If needed, you can link:task-manage-capacity-licenses.html#add-purchased-licenses-to-your-account[manually add the license to the BlueXP digital wallet].

. On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the steps in BlueXP.

.. On the *Details and Credentials* page, click *Edit Credentials > Add Subscription* and then follow the prompts to subscribe to the pay-as-you-go offering in the AWS Marketplace.
+
The license that you purchased from NetApp is always charged first, but you'll be charged from the hourly rate in the marketplace if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the term of your license expires.

=== PAYGO subscription

Pay hourly by subscribing to the offer from your cloud provider's marketplace.

When you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, BlueXP prompts you to subscribe to the agreement that's available in the AWS Marketplace. That subscription is then associated with the working environment for charging. You can use that same subscription for additional working environments.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the steps in BlueXP.

.. On the *Details and Credentials* page, click *Edit Credentials > Add Subscription* and then follow the prompts to subscribe to the pay-as-you-go offering in the AWS Marketplace.
