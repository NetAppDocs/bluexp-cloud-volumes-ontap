Some Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations in AWS and Azure include local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_ for better performance.

== What's Flash Cache?

Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It's effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services.

== Supported instances in AWS

Select one of the following EC2 instance types with a new or existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP Premium or BYOL system:

* c5d.4xlarge
* c5d.9xlarge
* c5d.18xlarge
* m5d.8xlarge
* m5d.12xlarge
* r5d.2xlarge

== Supported VM type in Azure

Select the Standard_L8s_v2 VM type with a single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system in Azure.

== Limitations

* Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements.

Choose no storage efficiency when creating a volume from Cloud Manager, or create a volume and then http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/GUID-8508A4CB-DB43-4D0D-97EB-859F58B29054.html[disable data compression by using the CLI^].

* Cache rewarming after a reboot is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
