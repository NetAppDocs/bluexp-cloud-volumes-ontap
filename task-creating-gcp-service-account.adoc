Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires a Google Cloud service account for two purposes. The first is when you enable link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering] to tier cold data to low-cost object storage in Google Cloud. The second is when you enable the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[BlueXP backup and recovery^] to back up volumes to low-cost object storage.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses the service account to access and manage one bucket for tiered data and another bucket for backups.

You can set up one service account and use it for both purposes. The service account must have the *Storage Admin* role.

.Steps

. In the Google Cloud console, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[go to the Service accounts page^].

. Select your project.

. Click *Create service account* and provide the required information.

.. *Service account details*: Enter a name and description.
.. *Grant this service account access to project*: Select the *Storage Admin* role.

+
.. *Grant users access to this service account*: Add the Connector service account as a _Service Account User_ to this new service account.
+
This step is required for data tiering only. It's not required for BlueXP backup and recovery.

.What's next?

You'll need to select the service account later when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.
