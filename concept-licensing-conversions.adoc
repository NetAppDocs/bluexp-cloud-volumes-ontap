Converting an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to another licensing method isn't supported. The three current licensing methods are capacity-based licensing, Keystone Flex Subscriptions, and node-based licensing. For example, you can't convert a system from node-based licensing to capacity-based licensing (and vice versa).

If you want to transition to another licensing method, you can purchase a license, deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using that license, and then replicate the data to that new system.
