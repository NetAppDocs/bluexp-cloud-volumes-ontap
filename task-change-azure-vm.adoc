You can choose from several VM types when you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Microsoft Azure. You can change the VM type at any time if you determine that it is undersized or oversized for your needs.

.About this task

* Automatic giveback must be enabled on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair (this is the default setting). If it isn't, then the operation will fail.

* Changing the VM type can affect Microsoft Azure service charges.

* The operation restarts Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
For single node systems, I/O is interrupted.
+
For HA pairs, the change is nondisruptive. HA pairs continue to serve data.
+
TIP: BlueXP gracefully changes one node at a time by initiating takeover and waiting for give back. NetApp's QA team tested both writing and reading files during this process and didn't see any issues on the client side. As connections changed, we did see retries on the I/O level, but the application layer overcame these short "re-wire" of NFS/CIFS connections.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, select the working environment.

. On the Overview tab, click the Features panel and then click the pencil icon next to *VM type*.

.. If you are using a node-based PAYGO license, you can optionally choose a different license and VM type by clicking the pencil icon next to *License type*.

. Select a VM type, select the check box to confirm that you understand the implications of the change, and then click *Change*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP reboots with the new configuration.
