Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS in a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Connector^] yet, an Account Admin needs to create one. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Learn how to create a Connector in AWS^]

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Note that if you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a subnet where no internet access is available, then you need to manually install the Connector and access the BlueXP user interface that's running on that Connector. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Learn how to manually install the Connector in a location without internet access^]

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Plan your configuration

[role="quick-margin-para"]
BlueXP offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. link:task-planning-your-config.html[Learn more].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VPC and subnets will support connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC for NetApp AutoSupport.
+
This step isn't required if you're deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a location where no internet access is available.

.. Set up a VPC endpoint to the S3 service.
+
A VPC endpoint is required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Set up the AWS KMS

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to use Amazon encryption with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to ensure that an active Customer Master Key (CMK) exists. You also need to modify the key policy for each CMK by adding the IAM role that provides permissions to the Connector as a _key user_. link:task-setting-up-kms.html[Learn more].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using BlueXP
