Support from NetApp is included with Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems, but you must first activate support by registering the systems with NetApp.

Registering a PAYGO system with NetApp is required to upgrade ONTAP software using any of the methods link:task-updating-ontap-cloud.html[described on this page].

TIP: A system that isn't registered for support will still receive the software update notifications that appear in BlueXP when a new version is available. But you will need to register the system before you can upgrade the software.

.Steps

. If you have not yet added your NetApp Support Site account to BlueXP, go to *Account Settings* and add it now.

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the system you want to register..

. On the Overview tab, click the Features panel and then click the pencil icon next to *Support Registration*.
