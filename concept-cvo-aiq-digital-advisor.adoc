NOTE: As of December 3, 2021, NetApp has switched to a new methodology of registering credentials for NSS accounts. https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Miscellaneous/FAQs_for_NetApp_adoption_of_MS_Azure_AD_B2C_for_login[See this FAQ for details]. If your NSS account uses the old set of credentials you will need to update the account to the new credentials.
