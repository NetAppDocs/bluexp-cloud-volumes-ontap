Google Cloud Platform (GCP) image verification complies with enhanced NetApp security requirements. Changes have been made to the script generating the images to sign the image along the way using private keys specifically generated for this task. You can verify the integrity of the GCP image by using the signed digest and public certificate for GCP which can be downloaded via https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-volumes-ontap/downloads-tab[NSS] for specific release.

NOTE: Google Cloud Platform image verification is supported on Cloud Volumes ONTAP software version 9.13.0 or greater.
