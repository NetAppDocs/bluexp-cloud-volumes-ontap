Set up your Google Cloud Platform networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly. This includes networking for the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

If you want to deploy an HA pair, you should link:concept-ha-google-cloud.html[learn how HA pairs work in GCP].

== Requirements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

The following requirements must be met in GCP.

Internal load balancers::
Cloud Manager automatically creates four Google Cloud internal load balancers (TCP/UDP) that manage incoming traffic to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair. No setup is required from your end. We've listed this as a requirement simply to inform you of the network traffic and to mitigate any security concerns.
+
One load balancer is for cluster management, one is for storage VM (SVM) management, one is for NAS traffic to node 1, and the last is for NAS traffic to node 2.
+
The setup for each load balancer is as follows:
+
* One shared private IP address
* One global health check
+
By default, the ports used by the health check are 63001, 63002, and 63003.
* One regional TCP backend service
* One regional UDP backend service
* One TCP forwarding rule
* One UDP forwarding rule
* Global access is disabled
+
Even though global access is disabled by default, enabling it post deployment is supported. We disabled it because cross region traffic will have significantly higher latencies. We wanted to ensure that you didn't have a negative experience due to accidental cross region mounts. Enabling this option is specific to your business needs.

One or multiple zones for HA pairs::
You can ensure the high availability of your data by deploying an HA configuration across multiple or in a single zone. Cloud Manager will prompt you to choose multiple zones or a single zone when you create the HA pair.
+
* Multiple zones (recommended)
+
Deploying an HA configuration across three zones ensures continuous data availability if a failure occurs within a zone. Note that write performance is slightly lower compared to using a single zone, but it's minimal.
* Single zone
+
When deployed in a single zone, a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configuration uses a spread placement policy. This policy ensures that an HA configuration is protected from a single point of failure within the zone, without having to use separate zones to achieve fault isolation.
+
This deployment model does lower your costs because there are no data egress charges between zones.

Four Virtual Private Clouds for HA pairs::
Four Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are required for an HA configuration. Four VPCs are required because GCP requires that each network interface resides in a separate VPC network.
+
Cloud Manager will prompt you to choose four VPCs when you create the HA pair:
+
* VPC-0 for inbound connections to the data and nodes
* VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3 for internal communication between the nodes and the HA mediator
+

Subnets for HA pairs::
A private subnet is required for each VPC.
+
If you place the Connector in VPC-0, then you will need to enable Private Google Access on the subnet to access the APIs and to enable data tiering.
+
The subnets in these VPCs must have distinct CIDR ranges. They can't have overlapping CIDR ranges.

One Virtual Private Cloud for single node systems::
One VPC is required for a single node system.

Shared VPCs::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP and the Connector are supported in a Google Cloud shared VPC and also in standalone VPCs.
+
For a single node system, the VPC can be either a shared VPC or a standalone VPC.
+
For an HA pair, four VPCs are required. Each of those VPCs can be either shared or standalone. For example, VPC-0 could be a shared VPC, while VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3 could be standalone VPCs.
+
A shared VPC enables you to configure and centrally manage virtual networks across multiple projects. You can set up shared VPC networks in the _host project_ and deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP virtual machine instances in a _service project_. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Google Cloud documentation: Shared VPC overview^].
+
The only requirement when using a shared VPC is to provide the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#compute.networkUser[Compute Network User role^] to the Connector service account. Cloud Manager needs these permissions to query the firewalls, VPC, and subnets in the host project.

Packet mirroring in VPCs::
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/packet-mirroring[Packet mirroring^] must be disabled in the Google Cloud VPC in which you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can't operate properly if packet mirroring is enabled.

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup
+
link:task-setting-up-ontap-cloud.html[Learn how to configure AutoSupport].
+
TIP: If you're using an HA pair, the HA mediator doesn't require outbound internet access.

Private IP addresses::
Cloud Manager allocates the following number of private IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP:

* *Single node*: 3 or 4 private IP addresses
+
You can skip creation of the storage VM (SVM) management LIF if you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP using the API and specify the following flag:
+
`skipSvmManagementLif: true`
+
A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port. A storage VM (SVM) management LIF is required for management tools like SnapCenter.

* *HA pair*: 15 or 16 private IP addresses
+
** 7 or 8 private IP addresses for VPC-0
+
You can skip creation of the storage VM (SVM) management LIF if you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP using the API and specify the following flag:
+
`skipSvmManagementLif: true`
** Two private IP addresses for VPC-1
** Two private IP addresses for VPC-2
** Three private IP addresses for VPC-3

Firewall rules::
You don't need to create firewall rules because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to the firewall rules listed below.
+
Note that two sets of firewall rules are required for an HA configuration:
+
* One set of rules for HA components in VPC-0. These rules enable data access to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. <<Firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP,Learn more>>.
* Another set of rules for HA components in VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3. These rules are open for inbound & outbound communication between the HA components. <<Firewall rules for VPC-1 VPC-2 and VPC-3,Learn more>>.

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Google Cloud Storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides must be configured for Private Google Access (if you're using an HA pair, this is the subnet in VPC-0). For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].
+
For additional steps required to set up data tiering in Cloud Manager, see link:task-tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in GCP and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the VPC and the other network—for example, your corporate network.
+
For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview[Google Cloud documentation: Cloud VPN overview^].

== Requirements for the Connector

Set up your networking so that the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-connector/task-configuring-proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server^].

=== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the VPCs in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. If you're deploying an HA pair, then the Connector needs a connection to VPC-0 only.

=== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

== Firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager creates GCP firewall rules that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Volumes ONTAP needs to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own firewall rules.

The firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

If you're deploying an HA configuration, these are the firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in VPC-0.

=== Inbound rules

The source for inbound rules in the predefined firewall is 0.0.0.0/0.

To create your own firewall, ensure that you add all networks that need to communicate with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, but also ensure to add both address ranges to allow the internal Google Load Balancer to function correctly. These addresses are 130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16. For more information, refer to https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp#firewall_rules[Google Cloud documentation: Load Balancer Firewall Rules^].

== Firewall rules for VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3

In GCP, an HA configuration is deployed across four VPCs. The firewall rules needed for the HA configuration in VPC-0 are <<Firewall rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP,listed above for Cloud Volumes ONTAP>>.

Meanwhile, the predefined firewall rules that Cloud Manager creates for instances in VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3 enables ingress communication over _all_ protocols and ports. These rules enable communication between HA nodes.

Communication from the HA nodes to the HA mediator takes place over port 3260 (iSCSI).

=== Using your own firewall rules with VPCs 1-3

When you create an HA pair, Cloud Manager gives you the option to use predefined firewall rules or to use existing rules for each VPC. If you use your own firewall rules for VPCs 1-3 and you're deploying the HA pair across multiple Google Cloud zones, then you must set up a _target tag_ for the firewall rule. If you don't set up target tags, then you'll experience an error during deployment.

. When you create the firewall rules in Google Cloud, go to the *Targets* field, select *Specified target tags*, and enter the tag.
+
The value can be any text string that you'd like.

. When you create the HA pair in Cloud Manager, select the existing firewall rules on the *Connectivity* page.
+
After the firewall rules are attached to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the target tag is automatically added to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP nodes as _network tags_.
