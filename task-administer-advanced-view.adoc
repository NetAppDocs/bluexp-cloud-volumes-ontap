summary: If you need to perform advanced management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager, which is a management interface that's provided with an ONTAP system. We have included the System Manager interface directly inside BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

[.lead]
Advanced storage management capabilities in Cloud Volumes ONTAP are available through ONTAP System Manager, a management interface provided with ONTAP systems. You can access System Manager directly from BlueXP.


== Features

You can perform various storage management functions using ONTAP System Manager in BlueXP. The following list includes some of those functionalities, though this list is not exhaustive:

* Advanced storage management: Manage consistency groups, shares, qtrees, quotas, and Storage VMs.
* Volume move: link:task-manage-volumes.html#move-a-volume[Move a volume to a different aggregate.]
* Networking management: Manage IPspaces, network interfaces, portsets, and ethernet ports.
* Manage FlexGroup volumes: You can create and manage FlexGroup volumes only through System Manager. BlueXP does not support FlexGroup volume creation.
* Events and jobs: View event logs, system alerts, jobs, and audit logs.
* Advanced data protection: Protect storage VMs, LUNs, and consistency groups.
* Host management: Set up SAN initiator groups and NFS clients.
* S3 object storage management: S3 storage management capabilities in Cloud Volumes ONTAP are available only in System Manager, and not in BlueXP.

== Supported configurations

* Advanced storage management through ONTAP System Manager is available in Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.10.0 and later in standard cloud regions. 
* System Manager integration is not supported in GovCloud regions or in regions that have no outbound internet access.

== Limitations

A few features that appear in the System Manager interface are not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* BlueXP tiering: Cloud Volumes ONTAP does not support the BlueXP tiering service. You should set up tiering of data to object storage directly from BlueXP's Standard View when creating volumes.

* Tiers: Aggregate management (including local tiers and cloud tiers) is not supported from System Manager. You must manage aggregates directly from BlueXP's Standard View.

* Firmware upgrades: Cloud Volumes ONTAP does not support automatic firmware updates from the *Cluster > Settings* page.

* Role-based access control: Role-based access control from System Manager is not supported.
* SMB Continuous Availability (CA) is not supported in Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can't create continuously available SMB shares for nondisruptive operations. For more information, refer to https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/da/NAS/NAS-KBs/What_are_SMB_Continuous_Availability_CA_Shares[What are SMB Continuous Availability (CA) Shares?]   

== Configure authentication for accessing System Manager

As an administrator, you can activate authentication for users accessing ONTAP System Manager from BlueXP. You can determine the right level of access permissions based on the ONTAP user roles, and enable or disable authentication as needed. If you enable authentication, then users need to enter their ONTAP user credentials every time they access System Manager from BlueXP or when the page is reloaded, because BlueXP doesn't store the credentials internally. If you disable authentication, users can access System Manager using BlueXP admin credentials.

[NOTE]
This setting is applicable per BlueXP Connector for the ONTAP users in your organization or account, irrespective of Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments or BlueXP projects.


.Required permissions

You need to be assigned BlueXP Organization or Account admin privileges to modify the BlueXP Connector settings for Cloud Volumes ONTAP user authentication.

.Steps
. Select the *Connector* drop-down from the BlueXP header.
. Select *Manage Connectors*.
. Click the action menu image:icon-action.png[ellipses icon] for the required Connector and select *Edit Connector*.
. Under *Force user credentials*, select the *Enable/Disable* check box. By default, authentication is disabled.
+
[NOTE]
If you set this value to *Enable*, authentication is reset, and you have to modify any existing workflows to accommodate this change. 
. Click *Save*.

== Get started with System Manager

You can access ONTAP System Manager from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

.Steps

. From the left navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, select a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. From the right panel, select *Services > System Manager > Open*.

. If prompted, enter your ONTAP user credentials and click *Login*.

. If the confirmation message appears, read through it and click *Close*.

. Use System Manager to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

. If needed, click *Switch to Standard View* to return to standard management through BlueXP.
