If you need to perform advanced management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager, which is a management interface that's provided with an ONTAP system. We have included the System Manager interface directly inside BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

This Advanced View is available as a Preview. We plan to refine this experience and add enhancements in upcoming releases. Please send us feedback by using the in-product chat.

== Features

The Advanced View in BlueXP gives you access to additional management features:

* Advanced storage management
+
Manage consistency groups, shares, qtrees, quotas, and Storage VMs.

* Networking management
+
Manage IPspaces, network interfaces, portsets, and ethernet ports.

* Events and jobs

View event logs, system alerts, jobs, and audit logs.

* Advanced data protection

== Supported configurations

Advanced management through System Manager is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.10.0 and later in standard cloud regions.

System Manager integration is not supported in GovCloud regions or in regions that have no outbound internet access.

== Limitations

A few features that appear in the System Manager interface are not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* BlueXP tiering

The BlueXP tiering service is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Tiering data to object storage must be set up directly from BlueXP's Standard View when creating volumes.

Automatic firmware updates from the *Cluster > Settings* page is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

In addition, role-based access control from System Manager is not supported.
