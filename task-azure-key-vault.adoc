You can use link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts[Azure Key Vault (AKV)^] to protect your ONTAP encryption keys in an Azure-deployed application.

AKV can be used to protect link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/configure-netapp-volume-encryption-concept.html[NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) keys^] only for data SVMs.

Key management with AKV can be enabled with the CLI or the ONTAP REST API.

When using AKV, be aware that by default a data SVM LIF is used to communicate with the cloud key management endpoint. A node management network is used to communicate with the cloud provider's authentication services (login.microsoftonline.com). If the cluster network is not configured correctly, the cluster will not properly utilize the key management service.

.Before you begin 
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be running version 9.10.1 or later
* Volume Encryption (VE) license installed (NetApp Volume Encryption license is automatically installed on each Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that is registered with NetApp Support)
* You must have a Multi-tenant Encryption Key Management (MT_EK_MGMT) license 
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator
* An Active Azure subscription

.Limitations
* AKV can only be configured on a data SVM

== Configuration process

The outlined steps capture how to register your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration with Azure and how to create an Azure Key Vault and keys. If you have already completed these steps, ensure you have the correct configuration settings, particularly in <<create-akv>>, and then proceed to <<ontap>>.

* <<azure-app>>
* <<secret>>
* <<create-akv>>
* <<key>>
* <<AAD>>
* <<ontap>>

[[azure-app]]
.Azure Application Registration
. You must first register your application in the Azure subscription that you want the Cloud Volumes ONTAP to use for access the Azure Key Vault. Within the Azure portal, select **App registrations**.
. Select **New registration**.
. Provide a name for your application and select a supported application type. The default single tenant suffices for Azure Key Vault usage. Select **Register**.
. In the Azure Overview window, select the application you have registered. Copy the **application (client) ID** and the **directory (tenant) ID** to a secure location. They will be required later in the registration process.

[[secret]]
.Create Azure client secret
. In the Azure portal for your Azure Key Vault app registration, select the **Certificates & secrets** pane.
. Select **New client secret**. Enter a meaningful name for your client secret. NetApp recommends a 24-month expiration period; however, your specific cloud governance policies may require a different setting.
. Click **Add** to create the client secret. Copy the secret string listed in the **Value** column and store it in a secure location for use later in <<ontap>>. The secret value will not be displayed again after you navigate away from the page.

[[create-akv]]
.Create an Azure Key Vault
. If you have an existing Azure Key Vault, you can connect it to your Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration; however, you must adapt the access policies to the settings in this process.
. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Key Vaults** section.
. Click **+Create** and enter the required information including resource group, region, and pricing tier. In addition, enter the number of days to retain deleted vaults and select **Enable purge protection** on the key vault.
. Select **Next** to choose an access policy.
. Select the following options: 
.. Under **Access configuration**, select the **Vault access policy**.
.. Under **Resource access**, select **Azure Disk Encryption for volume encryption**.
. Select **+Create** to add an access policy.
. Under **Configure from a template**, click the drop-down menu and then select the **Key, Secret, and Certificate Management** template.
. Choose each of the drop-down permissions menus (key, secret, certificate) and then **Select all ** at the top of the menu list to select all the permissions available. You should have:
** **Key permissions**: 20 selected
** **Secret permissions**: 8 selected
** **Certificate permissions**: 16 selected
+

. Click **Next** to select the **Principal** Azure registered application you created in <<azure-app>>. Select **Next**.
+
NOTE: Only one principal can be assigned per policy.
+

. Click **Next** two times until you arrive at **Review and create**. Then, click **Create**.
. Select **Next** to advance to **Networking** options.
. Choose the appropriate network access method or select **All networks** and **Review + Create** to create the key vault. (Network access method may be prescribed by a governance policy or your corporate cloud security team.)
. Record the Key Vault URI: In the key vault you created, navigate to the Overview menu and copy the **Vault URI** from the right-hand column. You need this for a later step.

[[key]]
.Create encryption key
. In the menu for the Key Vault you have created for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, navigate to the **Keys** option.
. Select **Generate/import** to create a new key.
. Leave the default option set to **Generate**.
. Provide the following information:
* Encryption key name
* Key type: RSA
* RSA key size: 2048
* Enabled:  Yes
. Select **Create** to create the encryption key.
. Return to the **Keys** menu and select the key you just created.
. Select the key ID under **Current version** to view the key properties.
. Locate the **Key Identifier** field. Copy the URI up to but not including the hexadecimal string.

[[AAD]]
.Create an Azure Active Directory Endpoint (HA only)
. This process is only required if you are configuring Azure Key Vault for an HA Cloud Volumes ONTAP Working Environment.
. In the Azure portal navigate to **Virtual Networks**.
. Select the Virtual Network where you deployed the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and select the **Subnets** menu on the left side of the page.
. Select the subnet name for you Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment from the list.
. Navigate to the **Service Endpoints** heading. In the drop-down menu, select the following: 
* **Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory**
* **Microsoft.KeyVault**
* **Microsoft.Storage** (optional) 
+
image:screenshot-azure-service-endpoints-services.png[Screenshot of Service Endpoints showing three selected services]
. Select **Save** to capture your settings.

[[ontap]]
.Cloud Volumes ONTAP configuration
. Connect to the cluster management LIF with your preferred SSH client.
. Enter the advanced privilege mode in ONTAP:
`set advanced -con off`
. Identify the desired data SVM and verify its DNS configuration:
`vserver services name-service dns show`
.. If a DNS entry for the desired data SVM exists and it contains an entry for the Azure DNS, then no action is required. If it does not, add a DNS server entry for the data SVM that points to the Azure DNS, private DNS, or on-premise server.  This should match the entry for the cluster admin SVM:
`vserver services name-service dns create -vserver _SVM_name_ -domains _domain_ -name-servers _IP_address_`
.. Verify the DNS service has been created for the data SVM:
`vserver services name-service dns show`
. Enable Azure Key Vault using the client ID and tenant ID saved after the application registration:
`security key-manager external azure enable -vserver _SVM_name_ -client-id _Azure_client_ID_ -tenant-id _Azure_tenant_ID_ -name _Azure_key_vault_name_ -key-id _Azure_key_ID_`
. Check the status of the key manager:
`security key-manager external azure check`
The output will look like:
+
[source]
----
::*> security key-manager external azure check

Vserver: data_svm_name
Node: akvlab01-01

Category: service_reachability
    Status: OK

Category: ekmip_server
    Status: OK

Category: kms_wrapped_key_status
    Status: UNKNOWN
    Details: No volumes created yet for the vserver. Wrapped KEK status will be available after creating encrypted volumes.

3 entries were displayed.
----
+
If the `service_reachability` status is not `OK`, the SVM cannot reach the Azure Key Vault service with all the required connectivity and permissions. Ensure that your Azure network policies and routing don't block your private vNet from reaching the Azure KeyVault Public endpoint. If they do, consider using an Azure Private endpoint to access the Key vault from within the vNet. You may also need to add a static hosts entry on your SVM to resolve the private IP address for your endpoint.
+
The `kms_wrapped_key_status` will report `UNKNOWN` at initial configuration. Its status will change to `OK` after the first volume is encrypted.

. OPTIONAL: Create a test volume to verify the functionality of NVE.
+
`vol create -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggr_ -size _size_ -state online -policy default`
+
If configured correctly, Cloud Volumes ONTAP will automatically create the volume and enable volume encryption.

. Confirm the volume was created and encrypted correctly. If it is, the `-is-encrypted` parameter will display as `true`.
`vol show -vserver _SVM_name_ -fields is-encrypted`
