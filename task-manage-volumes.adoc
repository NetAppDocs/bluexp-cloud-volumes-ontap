Cloud Manager enables you to manage volumes and CIFS servers. It also prompts you to move volumes to avoid capacity issues.

== Manage volumes

You can manage volumes as your storage needs change. You can view, edit, clone, restore, and delete volumes.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, double-click the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on which you want to manage volumes.

. Manage your volumes:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| View information about a volume | Select a volume, and then click *Info*.

| Edit a volume (read-write volumes only)
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Edit*.
.. Modify the volume's Snapshot policy, NFS protocol version, NFS access control list (export policy), or share permissions, and then click *Update*.

NOTE: If you need custom Snapshot policies, you can create them by using System Manager.

| Clone a volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Clone*.
.. Modify the clone name as needed, and then click *Clone*.

This process creates a FlexClone volume. A FlexClone volume is a writable, point-in-time copy that is space-efficient because it uses a small amount of space for metadata, and then only consumes additional space as data is changed or added.

To learn more about FlexClone volumes, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/home.html[ONTAP 9 Logical Storage Management Guide^].

| Restore data from a Snapshot copy to a new volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Restore from Snapshot copy*.
.. Select a Snapshot copy, enter a name for the new volume, and then click *Restore*.

| Create a Snapshot copy on demand
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Create a Snapshot copy*.
.. Change the name, if needed, and then click *Create*.

| Get the NFS mount command
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Mount Command*.
.. Click *Copy*.

| View the target iQN for an iSCSI volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Target iQN*.
.. Click *Copy*.
.. link:task-connect-lun.html[Use the IQN to connect to the LUN from your hosts].

| Change the underlying disk type
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Change Disk Type & Tiering Policy*.
.. Select the disk type, and then click *Change*.

NOTE: Cloud Manager moves the volume to an existing aggregate that uses the selected disk type or it creates a new aggregate for the volume.

| Change the tiering policy
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Change Disk Type & Tiering Policy*.
.. Click *Edit Policy*.
.. Select a different policy and click *Change*.

NOTE: Cloud Manager moves the volume to an existing aggregate that uses the selected disk type with tiering, or it creates a new aggregate for the volume.

| Delete a volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Delete*.
.. Click *Delete* again to confirm.

== Resize a volume

By default, a volume automatically grows to a maximum size when it's out of space. The default value is 1,000, which means the volume can grow to 11 times it's size. This value is configurable in a Connector's settings.

If you need to resize your volume, you can do it through https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-C04C2C72-FF1F-4240-A22D-BE20BB74A116.html[ONTAP System Manager^]. Be sure to take your system's capacity limits into consideration as you resize volumes. Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes/index.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] for more details.

== Modify the CIFS server

If you change your DNS servers or Active Directory domain, you need to modify the CIFS server in Cloud Volumes ONTAP so that it can continue to serve storage to clients.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the menu icon and then click *Advanced > CIFS setup*.

. Specify settings for the CIFS server:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| DNS Primary and Secondary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provide name resolution for the CIFS server.

The listed DNS servers must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain that the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join |	The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain that you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain |	The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | 	A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit | The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.
If you configure AWS Managed Microsoft AD as the AD server for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should enter *OU=Computers,OU=corp* in this field.

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

|===

. Click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP updates the CIFS server with the changes.

== Move a volume

Move volumes for capacity utilization, improved performance, and to satisfy service-level agreements.

You can move a volume in System Manager by selecting a volume and the destination aggregate, starting the volume move operation, and optionally monitoring the volume move job. When using System Manager, a volume move operation finishes automatically.

.Steps

. Use System Manager or the CLI to move the volumes to the aggregate.
+
In most situations, you can use System Manager to move volumes.
+
For instructions, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-vol-move/home.html[ONTAP 9 Volume Move Express Guide^].

== Move a volume when Cloud Manager displays an Action Required message

Cloud Manager might display an Action Required message that says moving a volume is necessary to avoid capacity issues, but that you need to correct the issue yourself. If this happens, you need to identify how to correct the issue and then move one or more volumes.

TIP: Cloud Manager displays these Action Required messages when an aggregate has reached 90% used capacity. If data tiering is enabled, the messages display when an aggregate has reached 80% used capacity. By default, 10% free space is reserved for data tiering. link:task-tiering.html#changing-the-free-space-ratio-for-data-tiering[Learn more about the free space ratio for data tiering].

.Steps

. <<Identify how to correct capacity issues,Identify how to correct the issue>>.

. Based on your analysis, move volumes to avoid capacity issues:

* <<Move volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues,Move volumes to another system>>.

* <<Move volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues,Move volumes to another aggregate on the same system>>.

=== Identify how to correct capacity issues

If Cloud Manager can't provide recommendations for moving a volume to avoid capacity issues, you must identify the volumes that you need to move and whether you should move them to another aggregate on the same system or to another system.

.Steps

. View the advanced information in the Action Required message to identify the aggregate that has reached its capacity limit.
+
For example, the advanced information should say something similar to the following: Aggregate aggr1 has reached its capacity limit.

. Identify one or more volumes to move out of the aggregate:

.. In the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

.. Select the aggregate, and then click *Info*.

.. Expand the list of volumes.
+
image:screenshot_aggr_volumes.gif[Screen shot: Shows the list of volumes in an aggregate in the aggregate information dialog box.]

.. Review the size of each volume and choose one or more volumes to move out of the aggregate.
+
You should choose volumes that are large enough to free space in the aggregate so that you avoid additional capacity issues in the future.

. If the system has not reached the disk limit, you should move the volumes to an existing aggregate or a new aggregate on the same system.
+
For details, see link:task-manage-volumes.html#moving-volumes-to-another-aggregate-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues].

. If the system has reached the disk limit, do any of the following:

.. Delete any unused volumes.

.. Rearrange volumes to free space on an aggregate.
+
For details, see link:task-manage-volumes.html#moving-volumes-to-another-aggregate-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues].

.. Move two or more volumes to another system that has space.
+
For details, see link:task-manage-volumes.html#moving-volumes-to-another-system-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues].

=== Move volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues

You can move one or more volumes to another Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to avoid capacity issues. You might need to do this if the system reached its disk limit.

.About this task

You can follow the steps in this task to correct the following Action Required message:

 Moving a volume is necessary to avoid capacity issues; however, Cloud Manager cannot perform this action for you because the system has reached the disk limit.

.Steps

. Identify a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that has available capacity, or deploy a new system.

. Drag and drop the source working environment on the target working environment to perform a one-time data replication of the volume.
+
For details, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-replication/task-replicating-data.html[Replicating data between systems^].

. Go to the Replication Status page, and then break the SnapMirror relationship to convert the replicated volume from a data protection volume to a read/write volume.
+
For details, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-replication/task-replicating-data.html#managing-data-replication-schedules-and-relationships[Managing data replication schedules and relationships^].

. Configure the volume for data access.
+
For information about configuring a destination volume for data access, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-sm-ic-fr/home.html[ONTAP 9 Volume Disaster Recovery Express Guide^].

. Delete the original volume.
+
For details, see link:task-manage-volumes.html#manage-volumes[Manage volumes].

=== Move volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues

You can move one or more volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues.

.About this task

You can follow the steps in this task to correct the following Action Required message:

 Moving two or more volumes is necessary to avoid capacity issues; however, Cloud Manager cannot perform this action for you.

.Steps

. Verify whether an existing aggregate has available capacity for the volumes that you need to move:

.. In the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

.. Select each aggregate, click *Info*, and then view the available capacity (aggregate capacity minus used aggregate capacity).
+
image:screenshot_aggr_capacity.gif[Screen shot: Shows the total aggregate capacity and used aggregate capacity available in the aggregate information dialog box.]

. If needed, add disks to an existing aggregate:

.. Select the aggregate, and then click *Add disks*.

.. Select the number of disks to add, and then click *Add*.

. If no aggregates have available capacity, create a new aggregate.
+
For details, see link:task-create-aggregates.html[Creating aggregates].

. Use System Manager or the CLI to move the volumes to the aggregate.

. In most situations, you can use System Manager to move volumes.
+
For instructions, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-vol-move/home.html[ONTAP 9 Volume Move Express Guide^].

== Reasons why a volume move might perform slowly

Moving a volume might take longer than you expect if any of the following conditions are true for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* The volume is a clone.
* The volume is a parent of a clone.
*	The source or destination aggregate has a single Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) disk.
*	The Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is in AWS and one aggregate uses an older naming scheme for objects. Both aggregates have to use the same name format.
+
An older naming scheme is used if data tiering was enabled on an aggregate in the 9.4 release or earlier.
* The encryption settings don't match on the source and destination aggregates, or a rekey is in progress.
* The _-tiering-policy_ option was specified on the volume move to change the tiering policy.
* The _-generate-destination-key_ option was specified on the volume move.
