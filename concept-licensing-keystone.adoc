[.lead]
A pay-as-you-grow subscription-based service that delivers a seamless hybrid cloud experience for those preferring OpEx consumption models to upfront CapEx or leasing.

== Overview

Charging is based on the size of your committed capacity for one or more Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in your Keystone Flex Subscription.

The provisioned capacity for each volume is aggregated and compared to the committed capacity on your Keystone Flex Subscription periodically, and any overages are charged as burst on your Keystone Flex Subscription.
