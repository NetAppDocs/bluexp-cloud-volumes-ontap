The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Working Environment Name | BlueXP uses the working environment name to name both the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and the Google Cloud VM instance. It also uses the name as the prefix for the predefined security group, if you select that option.

| Service Account Name | If you plan to use link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering] or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[BlueXP backup and recovery^] with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to enable *Service Account* and select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role. link:task-creating-gcp-service-account.html[Learn how to create a service account^].

| Add Labels |	Labels are metadata for your Google Cloud resources. BlueXP adds the labels to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and Google Cloud resources associated with the system.

You can add up to four labels from the user interface when creating a working environment, and then you can add more after its created. Note that the API does not limit you to four labels when creating a working environment.

For information about labels, refer to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources[Google Cloud Documentation: Labeling Resources^].

| User name and password | These are the credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster administrator account. You can use these credentials to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through System Manager or its CLI. Keep the default _admin_ user name or change it to a custom user name.

| Edit Project a| Select the project where you want Cloud Volumes ONTAP to reside. The default project is the project where BlueXP resides.

If you don't see any additional projects in the drop-down list, then you haven't yet associated the BlueXP service account with other projects. Go to the Google Cloud console, open the IAM service, and select the project. Add the service account with the BlueXP role to that project. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

NOTE: This is the service account that you set up for BlueXP, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[as described on this page^].

Click *Add Subscription* to associate the selected credentials with a subscription.

+
WORM can't be enabled if data tiering was enabled for Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions 9.7 and below. Reverting or downgrading to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 is blocked after enabling WORM and tiering. 
+
link:concept-worm.html[Learn more about WORM storage^].
.. If you activate WORM storage, select the retention period. 

. *Data Tiering in Google Cloud Platform*: Choose whether to enable data tiering on the initial aggregate, choose a storage class for the tiered data, and then either select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later), or select a Google Cloud account (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6).
+
Note the following:
+
* BlueXP sets the service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Be sure to add the Connector service account as a user of the tiering service account, otherwise, you can't select it from BlueXP
* For help with adding a Google Cloud account, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-gcp-accounts.html[Setting up and adding Google Cloud accounts for data tiering with 9.6^].
* You can choose a specific volume tiering policy when you create or edit a volume.
* If you disable data tiering, you can enable it on subsequent aggregates, but you'll need to turn off the system and add a service account from the Google Cloud console.
