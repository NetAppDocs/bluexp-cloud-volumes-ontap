Create a working environment in Cloud Manager to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.

.Steps

. [[subscribe]]On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts.

. *Choose a Location*: Select *Google Cloud* and *Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. If you're prompted, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-gcp.html[create a Connector^].

. *Details & Credentials*: Select a project, specify a cluster name, optionally select a Service Account, optionally add labels, and then specify credentials.
+
The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Working Environment Name | Cloud Manager uses the working environment name to name both the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and the GCP VM instance. It also uses the name as the prefix for the predefined security group, if you select that option.

| Service Account Name | If you plan to use link:concept-data-tiering.html[data tiering] or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-backup-restore/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[Cloud Backup^] with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to enable *Service Account* and select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role. link:task-creating-gcp-service-account.html[Learn how to create a service account].

| Add Labels |	Labels are metadata for your GCP resources. Cloud Manager adds the labels to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and GCP resources associated with the system.

You can add up to four labels from the user interface when creating a working environment, and then you can add more after its created. Note that the API does not limit you to four labels when creating a working environment.

For information about labels, refer to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources[Google Cloud Documentation: Labeling Resources^].

| User name and password | These are the credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster administrator account. You can use these credentials to connect to Cloud Volumes ONTAP through System Manager or its CLI. Keep the default _admin_ user name or change it to a custom user name.

| Edit Project a| Select the project where you want Cloud Volumes ONTAP to reside. The default project is the project where Cloud Manager resides.

If you don't see any additional projects in the drop-down list, then you haven't yet associated the Cloud Manager service account with other projects. Go to the Google Cloud console, open the IAM service, and select the project. Add the service account with the Cloud Manager role to that project. You'll need to repeat this step for each project.

NOTE: This is the service account that you set up for Cloud Manager, link:task-creating-gcp-service-account.html[as described on this page].

Click *Add Subscription* to associate the selected credentials with a subscription.

To create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you need to select a GCP project that's associated with a subscription to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP Marketplace.

|===
+
The following video shows how to associate a pay-as-you-go Marketplace subscription to your GCP project. Alternatively, follow the steps to subscribe located in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-gcp-accounts.html[Associating a Marketplace subscription with GCP credentials^] section.
+
video::video_subscribing_gcp.mp4[width=848, height=480]

. *Services*: Select the services that you want to use on this system. In order to select Cloud Backup, or to use Tiering, you must have specified the Service Account in step 3.

. *Location & Connectivity*: Select a location, choose a firewall policy, and select the checkbox to confirm network connectivity to Google Cloud storage for data tiering.
+
If you want to tier cold data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides must be configured for Private Google Access. For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud Documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].

. *Charging Methods and NSS Account*: Specify which charging option would you like to use with this system, and then specify a NetApp Support Site account.
+
* link:concept-licensing.html[Learn about these charging methods].
* link:task-deploying-gcp.html#licensing[Learn what's required in the wizard for the licensing method that you want to use].

. *Preconfigured Packages*: Select one of the packages to quickly deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, or click *Create my own configuration*.
+
If you choose one of the packages, you only need to specify a volume and then review and approve the configuration.

. *Licensing*: Change the Cloud Volumes ONTAP version as needed, select a license, and select a virtual machine type.
+
image:screenshot_cvo_licensing_gcp.gif[A screenshot of the Licensing page]
+
If your needs change after you launch the system, you can modify the license or virtual machine type later.
+
NOTE: If a newer Release Candidate, General Availability, or patch release is available for the selected version, then Cloud Manager updates the system to that version when creating the working environment. For example, the update occurs if you select Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 RC1 and 9.6 GA is available. The update does not occur from one release to anotherâ€”for example, from 9.6 to 9.7.

. *Underlying Storage Resources*: Choose settings for the initial aggregate: a disk type and the size for each disk.
+
The disk type is for the initial volume. You can choose a different disk type for subsequent volumes.
+
The disk size is for all disks in the initial aggregate and for any additional aggregates that Cloud Manager creates when you use the simple provisioning option. You can create aggregates that use a different disk size by using the advanced allocation option.
+
For help choosing a disk type and size, see link:task-planning-your-config-gcp.html#sizing-your-system-in-gcp[Sizing your system in GCP].

. *Write Speed & WORM*: Choose *Normal* or *High* write speed, and activate write once, read many (WORM) storage, if desired.
+
Choosing a write speed is supported with single node systems only.
+
link:concept-write-speed.html[Learn more about write speed].
+
WORM can't be enabled if Cloud Backup was enabled or if data tiering was enabled.
+
link:concept-worm.html[Learn more about WORM storage].

. *Data Tiering in Google Cloud Platform*: Choose whether to enable data tiering on the initial aggregate, choose a storage class for the tiered data, and then either select a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later), or select a GCP account (required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6).
+
Note the following:
+
* Cloud Manager sets the service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Be sure to add the Connector service account as a user of the tiering service account, otherwise, you can't select it from Cloud Manager.
* For help with adding a GCP account, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-gcp-accounts.html[Setting up and adding GCP accounts for data tiering with 9.6^].
* You can choose a specific volume tiering policy when you create or edit a volume.
* If you disable data tiering, you can enable it on subsequent aggregates, but you'll need to turn off the system and add a service account from the GCP console.
+
link:concept-data-tiering.html[Learn more about data tiering].

. *Create Volume*: Enter details for the new volume or click *Skip*.
+
Some of the fields in this page are self-explanatory. The following table describes fields for which you might need guidance:

. *CIFS Setup*: If you chose the CIFS protocol, set up a CIFS server.
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| DNS Primary and Secondary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provide name resolution for the CIFS server.
The listed DNS servers must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain that the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join | The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain that you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain | The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit | The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

| NTP Server | Select *Use Active Directory Domain* to configure an NTP server using the Active Directory DNS. If you need to configure an NTP server using a different address, then you should use the API. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/index.html[Cloud Manager automation docs^] for details.
|===

. *Usage Profile, Disk Type, and Tiering Policy*: Choose whether you want to enable storage efficiency features and change the volume tiering policy, if needed.
+
For more information, see link:task-planning-your-config-gcp.html#choosing-a-volume-usage-profile[Understanding volume usage profiles] and link:concept-data-tiering.html[Data tiering overview].
