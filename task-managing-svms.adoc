A storage VM is a virtual machine running within ONTAP that provides storage and data services to your clients. You might know this as an _SVM_ or a _vserver_. Cloud Volumes ONTAP is configured with one storage VM by default, but some configurations support additional storage VMs.

== Supported number of storage VMs

Multiple storage VMs are supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS and in Azure with certain configurations. Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes/index.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to verify the supported number of storage VMs for your version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Work with multiple storage VMs

Cloud Manager supports any additional storage VMs that you create from System Manager or the CLI.

For example, the following image shows how you can choose a storage VM when you create a volume.

And the following image shows how you can choose a storage VM when replicating a volume to another system.

== Modify the name of the default storage VM

Cloud Manager automatically names the single storage VM that it creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. You can modify the name of the storage VM if you have strict naming standards. For example, you might want the name to match how you name the storage VMs for your ONTAP clusters.

If you created any additional storage VMs for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you can't rename the storage VMs from Cloud Manager. You'll need to do so directly from Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Information*.

. Click the edit icon to the right of the storage VM name.

. In the Modify SVM Name dialog box, change the name, and then click *Save*.

== Manage storage VMs for disaster recovery

Cloud Manager doesn't provide any setup or orchestration support for storage VM disaster recovery. You must use System Manager or the CLI.
